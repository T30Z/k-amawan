# K’amawan – Exploring Maya Numerals, Myth, and Rituals

This project is a personal, research-driven exploration of ancient Maya civilization, centered around three key themes: Mayan numerals, the Popol Vuh, and the ritual ballgame Pok-ta-Pok. Through interactive pages, this project seeks to ignite curiosity about one of the most advanced pre-Columbian cultures. K’amawan is designed for lightweight performance, with a total size of just 819 KB, ensuring minimal resource consumption, complete offline functionality, and no reliance on external servers.

## Project Overview

- **Mayan Numbers** – A page inspired by the Maya **vigesimal numeral system**, where users can see how numbers were written using dots, bars, and shells. This section reflects the Maya's advanced understanding of mathematics and its role in their daily life and rituals.

- **Popol Vuh** – A digital representation of key excerpts from the **Popol Vuh**, the sacred book of the K’iche’ Maya. This version was created using an AI-assisted translation directly from the original K’iche’ text, aiming to move away from traditional Spanish interpretations and provide a perspective closer to the source language. The Popol Vuh recounts the creation of the world, the adventures of the Hero Twins, and the genealogy of the Quiché people. This section offers a way to engage with this rich narrative through an interactive format.

- **Pok-ta-Pok (Maya Ballgame)** – A simple browser game inspired by the ancient ritual ballgame **Pok-ta-Pok**, symbolizing the cosmic struggle between life and death. This page draws inspiration from the descriptions of the ballgame in the **Popol Vuh**, aiming to reflect its symbolic significance. While the game includes historical references, it remains a minimalist, imaginative interpretation meant for experimentation and fun.
