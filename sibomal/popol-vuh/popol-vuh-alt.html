        <p>Preamble 
        THIS IS THE BEGINNING of the old traditions of this place called Quiché.  
        Here we shall write and we shall begin the old stories, the beginning and the origin of all that 
        was done in the town of the Quiché, by the tribes of the Quiché nation. 
        And here we shall set forth the revelation, the declaration, and the narration of all that was 
        hidden, the revelation by Tzacol, Bitol, Alom, Qaholom, who are called Hunahpú-Vuch, 
        Hunahpú-Utiú, Zaqui-Nimá-Tziís, Tepeu, Gucumatz, u Qux cho, u Qux Paló, Ali Raxá Lac, 
        Ah Raxá Tzel, as they were called. And [at the same time] the declaration, the combined 
        narration of the Grandmother and the Grandfather, whose names are Xpiyacoc, and Xmucané, 
        helpers and protectors, twice grandmother, twice grandfather, so called in the Quiché 
        chronicles. Then we shall tell all that they did in the light of existence, in the light of history.  
        This we shall write now under the Law of God and Christianity; we shall bring it to light 
        because now the Popol Vuh, as it is called, cannot be seen any more, in which was dearly seen 
        the coming from the other side of the sea and the narration of our obscurity, and our life was 
        clearly seen. The original book, written long ago, existed, but its sight is hidden to the 
        searcher and to the thinker. Great were the descriptions and the account of how all the sky and 
        earth were formed, how it was formed and divided into four parts; how it was partitioned, and 
        how the sky was divided; and the measuring-cord was brought, and it was stretched in the sky 
        and over the earth, on the four angles, on the four corners, as was told by the Creator and the 
        Maker, the Mother and the Father of Life, of all created things, he who gives breath and 
        thought, she who gives birth to the children, he who watches over the happiness of the people, 
        the happiness of the human race, the wise man, he who meditates on the goodness of all that 
        exists in the sky, on the earth, in the lakes and in the sea.</p>
        <p><h1>PART I:</h1> <h2>Chapter 1: Creation of the World</h2> 
        This is the account of how all was in suspense, all calm, in silence; all 
        motionless, still, and the expanse of the sky was empty. 
        This is the first account, the first narrative. There was neither man, nor animal, birds, fishes, 
        crabs, trees, stones, caves, ravines, grasses, nor forests; there was only the sky. 
        The surface of the earth had not appeared. There was only the calm sea and the great expanse 
        of the sky. 
        There was nothing brought together, nothing which could make a noise, nor anything which 
        might move, or tremble, or could make noise in the sky. 
        There was nothing standing; only the calm water, the placid sea, alone and tranquil. Nothing 
        existed. 
        There was only immobility and silence in the darkness, in the night. Only the creator, the 
        Maker, Tepeu, Gucumatz, the Forefathers, were in the water surrounded with light. They were 
        hidden under green and blue feathers, and were therefore called Gucumatz. By nature they 
        were great sages and great thinkers. In this manner the sky existed and also the Heart of 
        Heaven, which is the name of God and thus He is called. 
        Then came the word. Tepeu and Gucumatz came together in the darkness, in the night, and 
        Tepeu and Gucumatz talked together. They talked then, discussing and deliberating; they 
        agreed, they united their words and their thoughts. 
        Then while they meditated, it became clear to them that when dawn would break, man must 
        appear. Then they planned the creation, and the growth of the trees and the thickets and the 
        birth of life and the creation of man. Thus it was arranged in the darkness and in the night by 
        the Heart of Heaven who is called Huracán. 
        The first is called Caculhá Huracán. The second is Chipi-Caculhá. The third is Raxa-Caculhá. 
        And these three are the Heart of Heaven.  
        Then Tepeu and Gucumatz came together; then they conferred about life and light, what they 
        would do so that there would be light and dawn, who it would be who would provide food and 
        sustenance. 
        Thus let it be done! Let the emptiness be filled! Let the water recede and make a void, let the 
        earth appear and become solid; let it be done. Thus they spoke. Let there be light, let there be 
        dawn in the sky and on the earth! There shall be neither glory nor grandeur in our creation and 
        formation until the human being is made, man is formed. So they spoke. 
        Then the earth was created by them. So it was, in truth, that they created the earth. Earth! they 
        said, and instantly it was made. 
        Like the mist, like a cloud, and like a cloud of dust was the creation, when the mountains 
        appeared from the water; and instantly the mountains grew.</p>
        <p>Only by a miracle, only by magic art were the mountains and valleys formed; and instantly 
        the groves of cypresses and pines put forth shoots together on the surface of the earth.  
        And thus Gucumatz was filled with joy, and exclaimed: "Your coming has been fruitful, Heart 
        of Heaven; and you, Huracán, and you, Chipi-Caculhá, Raxa-Caculhá!" 
        "Our work, our creation shall be finished," they answered. 
        First the earth was formed, the mountains and the valleys; the currents of water were divided, 
        the rivulets were running freely between the hills, and the water was separated when the high 
        mountains appeared. 
        Thus was the earth created, when it was formed by the Heart of Heaven, the Heart of Earth, as 
        they are called who first made it fruitful, when the sky was in suspense, and the earth was 
        submerged in the water. 
        So it was that they made perfect the work, when they did it after thinking and meditating upon 
        it. 
        I. <h2>Chapter 2: The Creation of the Animals</h2> 
        Then they made the small wild animals, the guardians of the woods, the spirits of the 
        mountains, the deer, the birds, pumas, jaguars, serpents, snakes. vipers, guardians of the 
        thickets. 
        And the Forefathers asked: 'Shall there be only silence and calm under the trees, under the 
        vines? It is well that hereafter there be someone to guard them." 
        So they said when they meditated and talked. Promptly the deer and the birds were created. 
        immediately they gave homes to the deer and the birds. "You, deer, shall sleep in the fields by 
        the river bank and in the ravines. Here you shall be amongst the thicket, amongst the pasture; 
        in the woods you shall multiply, you shall walk on four feet and they will support you. Thus 
        be it done!" So it was they spoke. 
        Then they also assigned homes to the birds big and small. "You shall live in the trees and in 
        the vines. There you shall make your nests; there you shall multiply; there you shall increase 
        in the branches of the trees and in the vines." Thus the deer and the birds were told; they did 
        their duty at once, and all sought their homes and their nests. 
        And the creation of all the four-footed animals and the birds being finished, they were told by 
        the Creator and the Maker and the Forefathers: "Speak, cry, warble, call, speak each one 
        according to your variety, each, according to your kind." So was it said to the deer, the birds, 
        pumas, jaguars, and serpents. 
        "Speak, then, our names, praise us, your mother, your father. Invoke then, Huracán, Chipi-
        Caculhá, Raxa-Caculhá, the Heart of Heaven, the Heart of Earth, the Creator, the Maker, the 
        Forefathers; speak, invoke us, adore us," they were told.</p>
        <p>But they could not make them speak like men; they only hissed and screamed and cackled; 
        they were unable to make words, and each screamed in a different way. 
        When the Creator and the Maker saw that it was impossible for them to talk to each other, 
        they said: "It is impossible for them to say our names, the names of us, their Creators and 
        Makers. This is not well," said the Forefathers to each other. 
        Then they said to them: "Because it has not been possible for you to talk, you shall be 
        changed. We have changed our minds: Your food, your pasture, your homes. and your nests 
        you shall have; they shall be the ravines and the woods, because it has not been possible for 
        you to adore us or invoke us. There shall be those who adore us, we shall make other [beings] 
        who shall be obedient. Accept your destiny: your flesh shall be tom to pieces. So shall it be. 
        This shall be your lot." So they said, when they made known their will to the large and small 
        animals which are on the face of the earth. 
        They wished to give them another trial; they, wished to make another attempt; they wished to 
        make [all living things] adore them. 
        But they could not understand each other's speech; they could succeed in nothing, and could 
        do nothing. For this reason they were sacrificed and the animals which were on earth were 
        condemned to be killed and eaten. 
        For this reason another attempt had to be made to create and make men by the Creator, the 
        Maker, and the Forefathers. 
        "Let us try again! Already dawn draws near: Let us make him who shall nourish and sustain 
        us! What shall we do to be invoked, in order to be remembered on earth? We have already 
        tried with our first creations, our first creatures; but we could not make them praise and 
        venerate us. So, then, let us try to make obedient, respectful beings who will nourish and 
        sustain us." Thus they spoke. 
        Then was the creation and the formation. Of earth, of mud, they made [man's] flesh. But they 
        saw that it was not good. It melted away, it was soft, did not move, had no strength, it fell 
        down, it was limp, it could not move its head, its face fell to one side, its sight was blurred, it 
        could not look behind. At first it spoke, but had no mind. Quickly it soaked in the water and 
        could not stand. 
        And the Creator and the Maker said: "Let us try again because our creatures will not be able 
        to walk nor multiply. Let us consider this," they said. 
        Then they broke up and destroyed their work and their creation. And they said: "What shall 
        we do to perfect it, in order that our worshipers, our invokers, will be successful?" 
        Thus they spoke when they conferred again: "Let us say again to Xpiyacoc, Xmucané, 
        Hunahpú-Vuch, Hunahpú-Utiú: 'Cast your lot again. Try to create again.'" In this manner the 
        Creator and the Maker spoke to Xpiyacoc and Xmucané. 
        Then they spoke to those soothsayers, the Grandmother of the day, the Grandmother of the 
        Dawn, as they were called by the Creator and the Maker, and whose names were Xpiyacoc 
        and Xmucané.</p>
        <p>And said Huracán, Tepeu, and Gucumatz when they spoke to the soothsayer, to the Maker, 
        who are the diviners: "You must work together and find the means so that man, whom we 
        shall make, man, whom we are going to make, will nourish and sustain us, invoke and 
        remember us. 
        "Enter, then, into council, grandmother, grandfather, our grandmother, our grandfather, 
        Xpiyacoc, Xmucané, make light, make dawn. have us invoked, have us adored, have us 
        remembered by created man, by made man, by mortal man. Thus be it done. 
        "Let your nature be known, Hunahpú-Vuch, Hunahpú-Utiú, twice-mother, twice-father, Nim-
        Ac, Nima-Tziís, the master of emeralds, the worker in jewels, the sculptor, the carver, the 
        maker of beautiful plates, the maker of green gourds, the master of resin, the master Toltecat, 
        grandmother of the sun, grandmother of dawn, as you will be called by our works and our 
        creatures. 
        "Cast the lot with your grains of corn and tzité. Do it thus and we shall know if we are to 
        make, or carve his mouth and eyes out of wood." Thus the diviners were told. 
        They went down at once to make their divination, and cast their lots with the corn and the 
        tzité. "Fate! Creature!" said an old woman and an old man. And this old man was the one who 
        cast the lots with Tzité, the one called Xpiyacoc. And the old woman was the diviner, the 
        maker, called Chiracán Xmucané.  
        Beginning the divination, they said: "Get together, grasp each other! Speak, that we may 
        hear." They said, "Say if it is well that the wood be got together and that it be carved by the 
        Creator and the Maker, and if this [man of wood] is he who must nourish and sustain us when 
        there is light when it is day! 
        "Thou, corn; thou, tzité; thou, fate; thou, creature; get together, take each other," they said to 
        the corn, to the tzité, to fate, to the creature. "Come to sacrifice here, Heart of Heaven; do not 
        punish Tepeu and Gucumatz!"  
        Then they talked and spoke the truth: "Your figures of wood shall come out well; they shall 
        speak and talk on earth." 
        "So may it be," they answered when they spoke. 
        And instantly the figures were made of wood. They looked like men, talked like men, and 
        populated the surface of the earth. 
        They existed and multiplied; they had daughters, they had sons, these wooden figures; but 
        they did not have souls, nor minds, they did not remember their Creator, their Maker; they 
        walked on all fours, aimlessly. 
        They no longer remembered the Heart of Heaven and therefore they fell out of favor. It was 
        merely a trial, an attempt at man. At first they spoke, but their face was without expression; 
        their feet and hands had no strength; they had no blood, nor substance, nor moisture, nor 
        flesh; their cheeks were dry, their feet and hands were dry, and their flesh was yellow.</p>
        <p>Therefore, they no longer thought of their Creator nor their Maker, nor of those who made 
        them and cared for them.  
        These were the first men who existed in great numbers on the face of the earth. 
        I. <h2>Chapter 3: The Creation of Man from Mud and Wood</h2> 
        Immediately the wooden figures were annihilated, destroyed, broken up, and killed. 
        A flood was brought about by the Heart of Heaven; a great flood was formed which fell on 
        the heads of the wooden creatures. 
        Of tzité the flesh of man was made, but when woman was fashioned by the Creator and the 
        Maker, her flesh was made of rushes. These were the materials the Creator and the Maker 
        wanted to use in making them. 
        But those that they had made, that they had created, did not think, did not speak with their 
        Creator, their Maker. And for this reason they were killed, they were deluged. A heavy resin 
        fell from the sky. The one called Xecotcovach came and gouged out their eyes; Camalotz 
        came and cut off their heads; Cotzbalam came and devoured their flesh. Tucumbalam came, 
        too, and broke and mangled their bones and their nerves, and ground and crumbled their 
        bones.  
        This was to punish them because they had not thought of their mother, nor their father, the 
        Heart of Heaven, called Huracán. And for this reason the face of the earth was darkened and a 
        black rain began to fall, by day and by night. 
        Then came the small animals and the large animals, and sticks and stones struck their faces. 
        And all began to speak: their earthen jars, their griddles, their plates, their pots, their grinding 
        stones, all rose up and struck their faces. 
        "You have done us much harm; you ate us, and now we shall kill you," said their dogs and 
        birds of the barnyard.   
        And the grinding stones said: "We were tormented by you; every day, every day, at night, at 
        dawn, all the time our faces went holi, holi, huqui, huqui, because of you. This was the tribute 
        we paid you. But now that you are no longer men, you shall feel our strength. We shall grind 
        and tear your flesh to pieces," said their grinding stones. 
        And then their dogs spoke and said: "Why did you give us nothing to eat? You scarcely 
        looked at us, but you chased us and threw us out. You always had a stick ready to strike us 
        while you were eating. 
        "Thus it was that you treated us. You did not speak to us. Perhaps we shall not kill you now; 
        but why did you not look ahead, why did you not think about yourselves? Now we shall 
        destroy you, now you shall feel the teeth of our mouths; we shall devour you," said the dogs, 
        and then, they destroyed their faces.</p>
        <p>And at the same time, their griddles and pots spoke: "Pain and suffering you have caused us. 
        Our mouths and our faces were blackened with soot; we were always put on the fire and you 
        burned us as though we felt no pain. Now you shall feel it, we shall burn you," said their pots, 
        and they all destroyed their [the wooden men's] faces. The stones of the hearth, which were 
        heaped together, hurled themselves straight from the fire against their heads causing them 
        pain.   
        The desperate ones [the men of wood] ran as quickly as they could; they wanted to climb to 
        the tops of the houses. 
        And the houses fell down and threw them to the ground; they wanted to climb to the treetops, 
        and the trees cast them far away; they wanted to enter the caverns, and the caverns repelled 
        them.   
        So was the ruin of the men who had been created and formed, the men made to be destroyed 
        and annihilated; the mouths and faces of all of them were mangled. 
        And it is said that their descendants are the monkeys which now live in the forests; these are 
        all that remain of them because their flesh was made only of wood by the Creator and the 
        Maker. 
        And therefore the monkey looks like man, and is an example of a generation of men which 
        were created and made but were only wooden figures. 
        I. <h2>Chapter 4: The Destruction of the Wooden Men</h2> 
        IT WAS CLOUDY AND TWILIGHT THEN ON the face of the earth. There was no sun yet. 
        Nevertheless, there was a being called Vucub-Caquix, who was very proud of himself. 
        The sky and the earth existed, but the faces of the sun and the moon were covered. 
        And he [Vucub-Caquix] said: "Truly, they are clear examples of those people who were 
        drowned, and their nature is that of supernatural beings.   
        "I shall now be great above all the beings created and formed. I am the sun, the light, the 
        moon," he exclaimed. "Great is my splendor. Because of me men shall walk and conquer. For 
        my eyes are of silver, bright, resplendent as precious stones, as emeralds; my teeth shine like 
        perfect stones, like the face of the sky. My nose shines afar like the moon, my throne is of 
        silver, and the face of the earth is lighted when I pass before my throne. 
        "So, then, I am the sun, I am the moon, for all mankind. So shall it be, because I can see very 
        far." 
        So Vucub-Caquix spoke. But he was not really the sun; he was only vainglorious of his 
        feathers and his riches. And he could see only as far as the horizon, and he could not see over 
        all the world. 
        The face of the sun had not yet appeared, nor that of the moon, nor the stars, and it had not 
        dawned. Therefore, Vucub-Caquix became as vain as though he were the sun and the moon,</p>
        <p>because the light of the sun and the moon had not yet shown itself His only ambition was to 
        exalt himself and to dominate. And all this happened when the flood came because of the 
        wooden-people. 
        Now we shall tell how Vucub-Caquix was overthrown and died, and how man was made by 
        the Creator and the Maker. 
        I. <h2>Chapter 5: The Story of Vucub-Caquix, the False Sun and Moon</h2> 
        THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE DEFEAT and the ruin of the glory of Vucub-Caquix 
        brought about by two youths, the first of whom was called Hunahpú and the second, 
        Xbalanqué. They were really gods. When they saw the harm which the arrogant one had done, 
        and wished to do, in the presence of the Heart of Heaven, the youths said: 
        "It is not good that it be so, when man does not yet live here on earth. Therefore, we shall try 
        to shoot him with our blowgun when he is eating. We shall shoot him and make him sicken, 
        and then that will be the end of his riches, his green stones, his precious metals, his emeralds, 
        his jewels of which he is so proud. And this shall be the lot of all men, for they must not 
        become vain, because of power and riches. 
        "Thus shall it be," said the youths, each one putting his blowgun to his shoulder. 
        Well, now Vucub-Caquix had two sons: the first was called Zipacná, the second was 
        Cabracán; and the mother of the two was called Chimalmat, the wife of Vucub-Caquix. 
        Well, Zipacná played ball with the large mountains: with Chigag, Hunahpú, Pecul, 
        Yaxcanul, Macamob, and Huliznab. These are the names of the mountains which existed 
        when it dawned and which were created in a single night by Zipacná. 
        In this way, then, Cabracán moved the mountains and made the large and small mountains 
        tremble. 
        And in this way the sons of Vucub-Caquix proclaimed their pride. "Listen! I am the sun!" said 
        Vucub-Caquix. "I am he who made the earth!" said Zipacná. "I am he who shook the sky and 
        made the earth tremble!" said Cabracán, In this way the sons of Vucub-Caquix followed the 
        example of their father's assumed greatness. And this seemed very evil to the youths. Neither 
        our first mother nor our first father had yet been created. 
        Therefore, the deaths of Vucub-Caquix and his sons and their destruction was decided upon 
        by the youths.</p>
        <p>I. <h2>Chapter 6: The Defeat of Vucub-Caquix</h2> 
        Now we shall tell how the two youths shot their blowguns at Vucub-Caquix and how each 
        one of those, who had become arrogant, was destroyed. 
        Vucub-Caquix had a large nantze tree and he ate the fruit of it. Each day he went to the tree 
        and climbed to the top. Hunahpú and Xbalanqué had seen that this fruit was his food. And 
        they lay in ambush at the foot of the tree, hidden among the leaves. Vucub-Caquix came 
        straight to his meal of nantzes. 
        Instantly he was injured by a discharge from Hun-Hunahpú's blowgun which struck him 
        squarely in the jaw, and screaming, he fell straight to earth from the treetop. 
        Hun-Hunahpú ran quickly to overpower him, but Vucub-Caquix seized his arm and 
        wrenching it from him, bent it back to the shoulder. In this way Vucub-Caquix tore out Hun-
        Hunahpú's arm. Surely the two youths did well in not letting themselves be defeated first by 
        Vucub-Caquix. 
        Carrying Hun-Hunahpú's arm, Vucub-Caquix went home, and arrived there nursing his jaw. 
        "What has happened to you, my lord?" said Chimalmat, his wife. 
        "What could it be, but those two demons who shot me with blowguns and dislocated my jaw? 
        For that reason my teeth are loose and pain me very much. But I have brought it [his arm], to 
        put it on the fire. Let it hang there over the fire, for surely these demons will come looking for 
        it." So said Vucub-Caquix as he hung up the arm of Hun-Hunahpú. 
        Having thought it over, Hun-Hunahpú and Xbalanqué went to talk with an old man who had 
        snow-white hair and with an old woman, really very old and humble, both already bent, like 
        very old people. The old man was called Zaqui-Nim-Ac and the old woman, Zaqui-Nima-
        Tziís. The youths said to the old woman and the old man: 
        "Come with us to Vucub-Caquix's house to get our arm. We will follow you, and you shall 
        tell them: 'These with us are our grandchildren; their mother and father are dead; so they 
        follow us everywhere we are given alms, for the only thing that we know how to do is take 
        the worm from the teeth.'  
        "So Vucub-Caquix shall think we are boys and we shall also be there to advise you," said the 
        two youths. 
        "Very well," answered the old man and woman. 
        Then they started out for the place where they found Vucub-Caquix reclining on his throne. 
        The old woman and man walked along followed by the two boys, who stayed behind them. In 
        this way they arrived at the house of the lord who was screaming because his tooth pained 
        him. 
        When Vucub-Caquix saw the old man and the old woman and those who accompanied them, 
        he asked, "Where do you come from, grandparents?"</p>
        <p>"We come looking for something to eat, honorable sir," they answered. 
        "And what do you eat? Are those not your sons who are with you?" 
        "Oh, no, sir! They are our grandsons; but we are sorry for them and what is given to us, we 
        share with them, sir," answered the old woman and the old man. 
        Meanwhile, the lord was suffering terrible pain from his tooth, and it was only with great 
        difficulty that he could speak. 
        "I earnestly beseech you to have pity on me. What can you do? What do you know how to 
        cure?" the lord asked them. 
        And the old ones answered, "Oh, sir! we only take the worm from the teeth, cure the eyes, and 
        set bones." 
        "Very well. Cure my teeth, which are really making me suffer day and night, and because of 
        them and of my eyes I cannot be calm and cannot sleep. All of this is because two demons 
        shot me with a pellet [from their blowgun] and for that reason I cannot eat. Have pity on me, 
        then, tighten my teeth with your hands." 
        "Very well, sir. It is a worm which makes you suffer. It will end when these teeth are pulled 
        and others put in their place." 
        "It is not well that you pull my teeth, because it is only with them that I am a lord and all my 
        ornaments are my teeth and my eyes." 
        "'We will put others of ground bone in their place." But the ground bone was nothing but 
        grains of white corn. 
        "Very well, pull them out, come and relieve me," he replied. 
        Then they pulled Vucub-Caquix's teeth; but in their place they put only grains of white corn, 
        and these grains of corn shone in his mouth. Instantly his features sagged and he no longer 
        looked like a lord. They removed the rest of his teeth which shone like pearls in his mouth. 
        And finally they cured Vucub-Caquix's eyes, piercing the pupils of his eyes, and they took all 
        his riches. 
        But he felt nothing any more. He only watched, because at the advice of Hunahpú and 
        Xbalanqué, they took from him all of the things of which he had been so proud. 
        Then Vucub-Caquix died. Hun-Hunahpú recovered his arm. Chimalmat, the wife of Vucub-
        Caquix, also perished. 
        In this way Vucub-Caquix lost his riches. The healer took all the emeralds and precious stones 
        which had been his pride here on earth. 
        The old woman and the old man who did this were miraculous beings; and having recovered 
        the arm of Hun-Hunahpú, they put it in place, and it was all right again.</p>
        <p>It was only to bring about the death of Vucub-Caquix that they did this, because it seemed 
        wicked to them that he should become so arrogant. 
        And then the two youths went on, having in this way carried out the order of the Heart of 
        Heaven. 
        I. <h2>Chapter 7: The Story of Zipacná and the Four Hundred Boys</h2> 
        Here now are the deeds of Zipacná the elder son of Vucub-Caquix. 
        "I am the creator of the mountains," said Zipacná. 
        Zipacná was bathing at the edge of a river when four hundred youths passed dragging a log to 
        support their house. The four hundred were walking, after having cut down a large tree to 
        make the ridge-pole of their house. 
        Then Zipacná came up, and going toward the four hundred youths, said to them: "What are 
        you doing, boys?" 
        "It is only this log," they answered, "which we cannot lift and carry on our shoulders." 
        "I will carry it. Where does it have to go? What do you want it for?" 
        "For a ridge-pole for our house." 
        "All right," he answered, and lifting it up, he put it on his shoulders and carried it to the 
        entrance of the house of the four hundred boys. 
        "Now stay with us, boy," they said. "Have you a mother or father;" 
        "I have neither," he answered. 
        "Then we shall hire you tomorrow to prepare another log to support our house." 
        "Good," he answered. 
        The four hundred boys talked together then. and said: 
        "How shall we kill this boy? Because it is not good what he has done lifting the log alone. Let 
        us make a big hole and push him so that he will fall into it. 'Go down and take out the earth 
        and carry it from the pit,' we shall tell him. and when he stoops down, to go down into the pit, 
        we shall let the large log fall on him and he will die there in the pit." 
        So said the four hundred boys, and then they dug a large, very deep pit. Then they called 
        Zipacná. 
        "We like you very much. Go, go and dig dirt, for we cannot reach [the bottom of the pit]," 
        they said.</p>
        <p>"All right," he answered. He went at once into the pit. And calling to him as he was digging 
        the dirt, they said: "Have you gone down very deep yet?" 
        "Yes," he answered beginning to dig the pit. But the pit which he was making was to save him 
        from danger. He knew that they wanted to kill him; so when he dug the pit, he made a second 
        hole at one side in order to free himself. 
        "How far [have you gone]?" the four hundred boys called down. 
        "I am still digging; I will call up to you when I have finished the digging," said Zipacná from 
        the bottom of the pit. But he was not digging his grave; instead he was opening another pit in 
        order to save himself. 
        At last Zipacná called to them. But when he called, he was already safe in the second pit. 
        "Come and take out and carry away the dirt which I have dug and which is in the bottom of 
        the pit," he said, "because in truth I have made it very deep. Do you not hear my call? 
        Nevertheless, your calls, your words repeat themselves like an echo once, twice, and so I hear 
        well where you are." So Zipacná called from the pit where he was hidden, shouting from the 
        depths. 
        Then the boys hurled the great log violently, and it fell quickly with a thud to the bottom of 
        the pit. 
        "Let no one speak! Let us wait until we hear his dying screams," they said to each other, 
        whispering, and each one covered his face as the log fell noisily. He [Zipacná] spoke then, 
        crying out, but he called only once when the log fell to the bottom. 
        "How well we have succeeded in this! Now he is dead," said the boys. "if, unfortunately, he 
        had continued what he had begun to do, we would have been lost, because he already had 
        interfered with us, the four hundred boys." 
        And filled with joy they said: "Now we must make our chicha within the next three days. 
        When the three days are passed, we shall drink to the construction of our new house, we, the, 
        four hundred boys." Then they said: "Tomorrow we shall look, and day after tomorrow, we 
        shall also look to see if the ants do not come out of the earth when the body smells and begins 
        to rot. Presently we shall become calm and drink our chicha," they said. 
        But from his pit Zipacná listened to everything the boys said. And later, on the second day, 
        multitudes of ants came, going and coming and gathering under the log. Some carried 
        Zipacná's hair in their mouths and others carried his fingernails. 
        When the boys saw this, they said, "That devil has now perished. Look how the ants have 
        gathered, how they have come by hordes, some bringing his hair and others his fingernails. 
        Look what we have done!" So they spoke to each other. 
        Nevertheless, Zipacná was very much alive. He had cut his hair and gnawed off his 
        fingernails to give them to the ants.</p>
        <p>And so the four hundred boys believed that he was dead, and on the third day they began the 
        orgy and all of the boys got drunk. And the four hundred being drunk knew nothing any more. 
        And then Zipacná let the house fall on their heads and killed all of them. 
        Not even one or two among the four hundred were saved; they were killed by Zipacná, son of 
        Vucub-Caquix. 
        In this way the four hundred boys died, and it is said that they became the group of stars 
        which because of them are called Motz, but it may not be true. 
        I. <h2>Chapter 8: The Defeat of Zipacná</h2> 
        Now we shall tell how Zipacná was defeated by the two boys, Hunahpú and Xbalanqué. 
        Now follows the defeat and death of Zipacná, when he was overcome by the two boys, 
        Hunahpú and Xbalanqué. 
        The boys' hearts were full of rancor because the four hundred young men had been killed by 
        Zipacná. And he only hunted fish and crabs at the bank of the river, which were his daily 
        food. During the day he went about looking for food, and at night he carried mountains on his 
        back. 
        With a leaf of the ec plant which is found in the forest, Hunahpú and Xbalanqué quickly made 
        a figure to look like a very large crab. 
        With this they made the stomach of the crab; the claws, they made of pahac, and for the shell, 
        which covers the back, they used a stone. Then they put the crab at the bottom of a cave at the 
        foot of a large mountain called Meaguán, where he was overcome. 
        Then the boys went to find Zipacná on the river bank. 
        "Where are you going, young man?" they asked him. 
        "I am not going anywhere," Zipacná answered, "only looking for food, boys." 
        "And what is your food?" 
        "Fish and crabs, but there are none here and I have not found any; I have not eaten since day 
        before yesterday, and I am dying of hunger," said Zipacná to Hunahpú and Xbalanqué. 
        "Over there in the bottom of the ravine there is a crab, a really large crab, and it would be well 
        if you would eat it! Only it bit us when we tried to catch it and so we were afraid. We 
        wouldn't try to catch it for anything," said Hunahpú and Xbalanqué. 
        "Have pity on me! Come and show it to me, boys," begged Zipacná. 
        "We do not want to. You go alone, you will not get lost. Follow the bank of the river and you 
        will come out at the foot of a large hill; there it is making a noise at the bottom of the ravine. 
        You have only to go there," said Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.</p>
        <p>"Oh, unfortunate me! Won't you accompany me, boys? Come and show it to me. There are 
        many birds which you can shoot with your blowguns and I know where to find them," said 
        Zipacná. 
        His meekness convinced the boys. And they asked him: But, can you really catch him? 
        Because it is only for you that we are returning; we are not going to try to get it again because 
        it bit us when we were crawling into the cave. After that we were afraid to crawl in, but we 
        almost caught it. So, then, it is best that you crawl in," they said. 
        "Very well," said Zipacná, and then they went with him. They arrived at the bottom of the 
        ravine and there, stretched on his back, was the crab, showing his red shell. And there also in 
        the bottom of the ravine was the boys' hoax.  
        "Good! Good!" said Zipacná happily. "I should like to have it in my mouth already!" And he 
        was really dying of hunger. He wanted to try to crawl in, he wanted to enter, but the crab was 
        climbing. He came out at once and the boys asked, "Did you not get it?" 
        "No," he answered," because he was going up and I almost caught him. But perhaps it would 
        be good if I go in from above," he added. And then he entered again from above, but as he 
        was almost inside, with only the soles of his feet showing, the great hill slid and fell slowly 
        down on his chest. 
        Zipacná never returned and he was changed into stone. 
        In this way Zipacná was defeated by the two boys, Hunahpú and Xbalanqué; he was the elder 
        son of Vucub-Caquix, and he, according to the ancient legend, was the one who made the 
        mountains. 
        At the foot of the hill called Meaguán he was vanquished. Only by a miracle was he 
        vanquished, the second of the arrogant ones. One was left, whose history we shall tell now. 
        I. <h2>Chapter 9: The Defeat of Cabracán, the Earthquake God</h2> 
        The third of the arrogant ones was the second son of Vucub-Caquix who was called Cabracán. 
        "I demolish the mountains," he said. 
        But Hunahpú and Xbalanqué also defeated Cabracán. Huracán, Chipi-Caculhá, and Raxa-
        Caculhá talked and said to Hunahpú and Xbalanqué: 
        "Let the second son of Vucub-Caquix also be defeated. This is our will, for it is not well what 
        they do on earth, exalting their glory, their grandeur, and their power, and it must not be so. 
        Lure him to where the sun rises," said Huracán to the two youths. 
        "Very well, honored sir," they answered, "because what we see is not right. Do you not exist, 
        you who are the peace, you, Heart of Heaven?" said the boys as they listened to the command 
        of Huracán.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Cabracán was busy shaking the mountains. At the gentlest tap of his feet on the 
        earth, the large and small mountains opened. Thus the boys found him and asked Cabracán: 
        "Where are you going, young man? 
        "Nowhere," he answered," here I am moving the mountains, and I am leveling them to the 
        ground forever," he answered. 
        Then Cabracán asked Hunahpú and Xbalanqué, "What did you come to do here? I do not 
        recognize you. What are your names?" said Cabracán. 
        "We have no names," they answered, "we are nothing more than shooters of blowguns and 
        hunters with bird-traps on the mountains. We are poor and we have nothing, young man. We 
        only walk over the large and small mountains, young man, and we have just seen a large 
        mountain, over there where you see the pink sky. It really rises up very high and overlooks the 
        tops of all the hills. So it is that we have not been able to catch even one or two of the birds on 
        it, boy. But, is it true that you can level all the mountains?" Hunahpú and Xbalanqué asked 
        Cabracán. 
        "Have you really seen the mountain of which you speak? Where is it? If I see it, I shall 
        demolish it. Where did you see it?" 
        "Over there it is, where the sun rises," said Hunahpú and Xbalanqué. 
        "Very well, show me the road," he said to the two boys. 
        "Oh no!" they answered. "We must take you between us. One shall go at your left and the 
        other at your right, because we have our blowguns, and if there should be birds we can shoot 
        them." And so they set out happily, trying out their blowguns. But when they shot with them, 
        they did not use the clay pellets in the tube of the blowgun; instead they felled the birds only 
        with the puff of air when they shot them, which surprised Cabracán very much. 
        Then the boys built a fire and put the birds on it to roast, but they rubbed one of the birds with 
        chalk, covering it with a white earth soil. 
        "We shall give him this," they said, "to whet his appetite with the odor which it gives off. This 
        bird of ours shall be his ruin, as we cover this bird with earth so we shall bring him down to 
        the earth and bury him in the earth. 
        "Great shall be the wisdom of a created being, of a being fashioned, when it dawns, when 
        there is light," said the boys.   
        "As it is natural for man to wish to eat, so Cabracán desires food," said Hunahpú and 
        Xbalanqué to each other. 
        Meanwhile the birds were roasting, they were beginning to turn golden brown, and the fat and 
        juice which dripped from them made an appetizing odor. Cabracán wanted very much to eat 
        them; they made his mouth water, he yawned, and the saliva and spittle drooled because of 
        the smell which the birds gave off.</p>
        <p>Then he asked them: "What is that you eat? The smell is really savoury. Give me a little 
        piece," he said to them. 
        Then they gave a bird to Cabracán, the one which would be his ruin; and when he had 
        finished eating it, they set out toward the east where the great mountain was. But already 
        Cabracán's legs and hands were weakening and he had no strength because of the earth with 
        which the bird he had eaten was rubbed, and he could do nothing to the mountains. Neither 
        was it possible to level them. 
        Then the boys tied him, they tied his hands behind him and also tied his neck and his feet 
        together. Then they threw him to the ground and there they buried him. 
        In this way Cabracán was overcome by Hunahpú and Xbalanqué. It would be impossible to 
        tell of all the things they did here on earth. 
        Now we shall tell of the birth of Hunahpú and Xbalanqué, having first told of the destruction 
        of Vucub-Caquix and that of Zipacná and of Cabracán, here on earth. 
        
        <h1>PART II:</h1>

        <h2>Chapter 1: The Birth of Hunahpú and Xbalanqué</h2>
        <p>Now we shall also tell the name of the father of Hunahpú and Xbalanqué. We shall not tell his origin and we shall not tell the history of the birth of Hunahpú and Xbalanqué. We shall tell only half of it, only a part of the history of his father. Here is the story. Here are the names of Hun-Hunahpú [and Vucub-Hunahpú], as they are called. Their parents were Xpiyacoc and Xmucané. During the night Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú were born of Xpiyacoc and Xmucané.</p>
        <p>Well now, Hun-Hunahpú had begotten two sons; the first was called Hunbatz and the second Hunchouén. The mother of the two sons was called Xbaquiyalo. Thus was the wife of Hun-Hunahpú called. As for the other son, Vucub-Hunahpú, he had no wife; he was single. By nature these two sons were very wise, and great was their wisdom; on earth they were soothsayers of good disposition and good habits. All the arts were taught to Hunbatz and Hunchouén, the sons of Hun-Hunahpú. They were flautists, singers, shooters with blowguns, painters, sculptors, jewelers, silversmiths; these were Hunbatz and Hunchouén.</p>
        <p>Well, Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú did nothing but play dice and ball all day long; and when the four got together to play ball, one pair played against the other pair. And Voc, the messenger of Huracán, of Chipi-Caculhá, of Raxa-Caculhá came there to watch them, but Voc did not stay far from the earth nor far from Xibalba, and in an instant he went up to heaven to the side of Huracán. They were still here on earth when the mother of Hunbatz and Hunchouén died.</p>
        <p>And having gone to play ball on the road to Xibalba, they were overheard by Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé, the lords of Xibalba. "What are they doing on earth? Who are they who are making the earth shake, and making so much noise? Go and call them! Let them come here to play ball. Here we will overpower them! We are no longer respected by them. They no longer have consideration, or fear of our rank, and they even fight above our heads," said all the lords of Xibalba. All of them held a council. Those called Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé were the supreme judges. All the lords had been assigned their duties. Each one was given his own authority by Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé.</p>
        <p>They were, then, Xiquiripat and Cuchumaquic lords of these names. They were the two who caused the shedding of blood of the men. Others were called Ahalpuh and Ahalganá, also lords. And their work was to make men swell and make pus gush forth from their legs and stain their faces yellow, what is called Chuganal. Such was the work of Ahalpuh and Ahalganá. Others were Lord Chamiabac and Lord Chamiaholom, constables of Xibalba whose staffs were of bone. Their work was to make men waste away until they were nothing but skin and bone and they died, and they carried them with their stomach and bones stretched out. This was the work of Chamiabac and Chamiaholom, as they were called. Others were called Lord Ahalmez and Lord Ahaltocob; their work was to bring disaster upon men, as they were going home, or in front of it, and they would be found wounded, stretched out, face up, on the ground, dead. This was the work of Ahalmez and Ahaltocob, as they were called.</p>
        <p>Immediately after them were other lords named Xic and Patán whose work it was to cause men to die on the road, which is called sudden death, making blood rush to their mouths until they died vomiting blood. The work of each one of these lords was to seize upon them, squeeze their throats and chests, so that the men died on the road, making the blood rush to their throats when they were walking. This was the work of Xic and Patán.</p>
        <p>And having gathered in council, they discussed how to torment and wound Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú. What the Lords of Xibalba coveted were the playing implements of Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú-their leather pads and rings and gloves and crown and masks which were the playing gear of Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú.</p>
        <p>Now we shall tell of their journey to Xibalba and how they left behind them the sons of Hun-Hunahpú, Hunbatz, and [Hun] Chouén, whose mother had died. Then we shall tell how Hunbatz and Hunchouén were overcome by Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.</p>
        
        <h2>Chapter 2: The Trials of Hunahpú and Xbalanqué in Xibalba</h2>
        <p>The messengers of Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé arrived immediately. "Go, Ahpop Achih!" they were told. "Go and call Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú. Say to them, 'Come with us. The lords say that you must come.' They must come here to play ball with us so that they shall make us happy, for really they amaze us. So, then, they must come," said the lords. "And have them bring their playing gear, their rings, their gloves, and have them bring their rubber balls, too," said the lords. "Tell them to come quickly," they told the messengers.</p>
        <p>And these messengers were owls: Chabi-Tucur, Huracán-Tucur, Caquix-Tucur and Holom-Tucur. These were the names of the messengers of Xibalba. Chabi-Tucur was swift as an arrow; Huracán-Tucur had only one leg; Caquix-Tucur had a red back, and Holom-Tucur had only a head, no legs, but he had wings. The four messengers had the rank of Ahpop-Achih. Leaving Xibalba, they arrived quickly, bringing their message to the court where Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú were playing ball, at the ball-court which was called Nim-Xob-Carchah. The owl messengers went directly to the ball-court and delivered their message exactly as it was given to them by Hun-Camé, Vucub-Camé, Ahalpuh, Ahalganá, Chamiabac, Chamiaholom, Xiquiripat, Cuchumaquic, Ahalmez, Ahaltocob, Xic, and Patán, as the lords were called who sent the message by the owls.</p>
        <p>"Did the Lords Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé really say that we must go with you?" "They certainly said so, and 'Let them bring all their playing gear,' the lords said." "Very well," said the youths. "Wait for us, we are only going to say good-bye to our mother."</p>
        <p>And having gone straight home, they said to their mother, for their father was dead: "We are going, our mother, but our going is only for a while. The messengers of the lord have come to take us. 'They must come,' they said, according to the messengers. We shall leave our ball here in pledge," they added. They went immediately to hang it in the space under the rooftree. "We will return to play," they said. And going to Hunbatz and Hunchouén they said to them: "Keep on playing the flute and singing, painting, and carving; warm our house and warm the heart of your grandmother."</p>
        <p>When they took leave of their mother, Xmucané was moved and burst into tears. "Do not worry, we are going, but we have not died yet," said Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú as they left.</p>
        <p>Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú went immediately and the messengers took them on the road. Thus they were descending the road to Xibalba, by some very steep stairs. They went down until they came to the bank of a river which flowed rapidly between the ravines called Nuziván cul and Cuziván, and crossed it. Then they crossed the river which flows among thorny calabash trees. There were very many calabash trees, but they passed through them without hurting themselves.</p>
        <p>Then they came to the bank of a river of blood and crossed it without drinking its waters; they only went to the river bank and so they were not overcome. They went on until they came to where four roads joined, and there at the crossroads they were overcome. One of the four roads was red, another black, another white, and another yellow. And the black road said to them: "I am the one you must take because I am the way of the Lord." So said the road.</p>
        <p>And from here on they were already overcome. They were taken over the road to Xibalba and when they arrived at the council room of the Lords of Xibalba, they had already lost the match. Well, the first ones who were seated there were only figures of wood, arranged by the men of Xibalba. These they greeted first: "How are you, Hun-Camé?" they said to the wooden man. "How are you, Vucub-Camé?" they said to the other wooden man. But they did not answer. instantly the Lords of Xibalba burst into laughter and all the other lords began to laugh loudly, because they already took for granted the downfall and defeat of Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú. And they continued to laugh.</p>
        <p>Then Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé spoke: "Very well," they said. "You have come. Tomorrow you shall prepare the mask, your rings, and your gloves," they said. "Come and sit down on our bench," they said. But the bench which they offered them was of hot stone, and when they sat down they were burned. They began to squirm around on the bench, and if they had not stood up they would have burned their seats.</p>
        <p>The Lords of Xibalba burst out laughing again; they were dying of laughter; they writhed from pain in their stomach, in their blood, and in their bones, caused by their laughter, all the Lords of Xibalba laughed. "Go now to that house," they said. "There you will get your sticks of fat pine and your cigar and there you shall sleep."</p>
        <p>Immediately they arrived at the House of Gloom. There was only darkness within the house. Meanwhile the Lords of Xibalba discussed what they should do. "Let us sacrifice them tomorrow, let them die quickly, quickly, so that we can have their playing gear to use in play," said the Lords of Xibalba to each other.</p>
        <p>Well, their fat-pine sticks were round and were called zaquitoc, which is the pine of Xibalba. Their fat-pine sticks were pointed and filed and were as bright as bone; the pine of Xibalba was very hard. Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú entered the House of Gloom. There they were given their fat-pine sticks, a single lighted stick which Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé sent them, together with a lighted cigar for each of them which the lords had sent. They went to give them to Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú.</p>
        <p>They found them crouching in the darkness when the porters arrived with the fat-pine sticks and the cigars. As they entered, the pine sticks lighted the place brightly. "Each of you light your pine sticks and your cigars; come and bring them back at dawn, you must not burn them up, but you must return them whole; this is what the lords told us to say." So they said. And so they were defeated. They burned up the pine sticks, and they also finished the cigars which had been given to them.</p>
        <p>There were many punishments in Xibalba; the punishments were of many kinds. The first was the House of Gloom, Quequma-ha, in which there was only darkness. The second was Xuxulim-ha, the house where everybody shivered, in which it was very cold. A cold, unbearable wind blew within. The third was the House of Jaguars, Balami-ha, it was called, in which there were nothing but jaguars which stalked about, jumped around, roared, and made fun. The jaguars were shut up in the house. Zotzi-há, the House of Bats, the fourth place of punishment was called. Within this house there were nothing but bats which squeaked and cried and flew around and around. The bats were shut in and could not get out.</p>
        <p>The fifth was called Chayim-há, the House of Knives, in which there were only sharp, pointed knives, silent or grating against each other in the house. There were many places of torture in Xibalba, but Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú did not enter them. We only mention the names of these houses of punishment.</p>
        <p>When Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú came before Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé, they said: "Where are my cigars? Where are my sticks of fat pine which I gave you last night?" "They are all gone, Sir." "Well. Today shall be the end of your days. Now you shall die. You shall be destroyed, we will break you into pieces and here your faces will stay hidden. You shall be sacrificed," said Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé.</p>
        <p>They sacrificed them immediately and buried them in the Pucbal-Chah, as it was called. Before burying them, they cut off the head of Hun-Hunahpú and buried the older brother together with the younger brother. "Take the head and put it in that tree which is Planted on the road," said Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé. And having put the head in the tree, instantly the tree, which had never borne fruit before the head of Hun-Hunahpú was placed among its branches, was covered with fruit. And this calabash tree, it is said, is the one which we now call the head of Hun-Hunahpú.</p>
        <p>Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé looked in amazement at the fruit on the tree. The round fruit was everywhere; but they did not recognize the head of Hun-Hunahpú; it was exactly like the other fruit of the calabash tree. So it seemed to all of the people of Xibalba when they came to look at it.</p>
        <p>According to their judgment, the tree was miraculous, because of what had instantly occurred when they put Hun-Hunahpú's head among its branches. And the Lords of Xibalba said: "Let no one come to pick this fruit. Let no one come and sit under this tree!" they said, and so the Lords of Xibalba resolved to keep everybody away.</p>
        <p>The head of Hun-Hunahpú did not appear again because it had become one and the same as the fruit of the gourd tree. Nevertheless, a girl heard the wonderful story. Now we shall tell about her arrival.</p>
        
        <h2>Chapter 3: The Defeat of the Lords of Xibalba</h2>
        <p>THIS is the story of a maiden, the daughter of a lord named Cuchumaquic. A maiden, then, daughter of a lord heard this story. The name of the father was Cuchumaquic and that of the maiden was Xquic. When she heard the story of the fruit of the tree which her father told, she was amazed to hear it.</p>
        <p>"Why can I not go to see this tree which they tell about?" the girl exclaimed. "Surely the fruit of which I hear tell must be very good." Finally she went alone and arrived at the foot of the tree which was planted in Pucbal-Chah.</p>
        <p>"Ah!" she exclaimed. "What fruit is this which this tree bears? Is it not wonderful to see how it is covered with fruit? Must I die, shall I be lost, if I pick one of this fruit?" said the maiden.</p>
        <p>Then the skull which was among the branches of the tree spoke up and said: "What is it you wish? Those round objects which cover the branches of the trees are nothing but skulls." So spoke the head of Hun-Hunahpú turning to the maiden. "Do you, perchance, want them?" it added.</p>
        <p>"Yes, I want them," the maiden answered.</p>
        <p>"Very well," said the skull. "Stretch your right hand up here."</p>
        <p>"Very well," said the maiden, and with her right hand reached toward the skull.</p>
        <p>In that instant the skull let a few drops of spittle fall directly into the maiden's palm. She looked quickly and intently at the palm of her hand, but the spittle of the skull was not there.</p>
        <p>"In my saliva and spittle I have given you my descendants," said the voice in the tree. "Now my head has nothing on it any more, it is nothing but a skull without flesh. So are the heads of the great princes, the flesh is all which gives them a handsome appearance. And when they die, men are frightened by their bones. So, too, is the nature of the sons, which are like saliva and spittle, they may be sons of a lord, of a wise man, or of an orator. They do not lose their substance when they go, but they bequeath it; the image of the lord, of the wise man, or of the orator does not disappear, nor is it lost, but he leaves it to the daughters and to the sons which he begets. I have done the same with you. Go up, then, to the surface of the earth, that you may not die. Believe in my words that it will be so," said the head of Hun-Hunahpú and of Vucub-Hunahpú.</p>
        <p>And all that they did together was by order of Huracán, Chipi-Caculhá, and Raxa-Caculhá. After all of the above talking, the maiden returned directly to her home, having immediately conceived the sons in her belly by virtue of the spittle only. And thus Hunahpú and Xbalanqué were begotten.</p>
        
        <p>And so the girl returned home, and after six months had passed, her father, who was called Cuchumaquic, noticed her condition. At once the maiden's secret was discovered by her father when he observed that she was pregnant.</p>
        <p>Then the lords, Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé, held council with Cuchumaquic. "My daughter is pregnant, Sirs; she has been disgraced," exclaimed Cuchumaquic when he appeared before the lords.</p>
        <p>"Very well," they said. "Command her to tell the truth, and if she refuses to speak, punish her; let her be taken far from here and sacrifice her."</p>
        <p>"Very well, Honorable Lords," he answered. Then he questioned his daughter: "Whose are the children that you carry, my daughter?" And she answered, "I have no child, my father, for I have not yet known a youth."</p>
        <p>"Very well," he replied. "You are really a whore. Take her and sacrifice her, Ahpop Achih; bring me her heart in a gourd and return this very day before the lords," he said to the two owls.</p>
        <p>The four messengers took the gourd and set out carrying the young girl in their arms and also taking the knife of flint with which to sacrifice her. And she said to them: "It cannot be that you will kill me, oh, messengers, because what I bear in my belly is no disgrace, but was begotten when I went to marvel at the head of Hun-Hunahpú which was in Pucbal-Chah. So, then, you must not sacrifice me, oh, messengers!" said the young girl, turning to them.</p>
        <p>"And what shall we put in place of your heart? Your father told us: 'Bring the heart, return before the lords, do your duty, all working together, bring it in the gourd quickly, and put the heart in the bottom of the gourd.' Perchance, did he not speak to us so? What shall we put in the gourd? We wish too, that you should not die," said the messengers.</p>
        <p>"Very well, but my heart does not belong to them. Neither is your home here, nor must you let them force you to kill men. Later, in truth, the real criminals will be at your mercy and I will overcome Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé. So, then, the blood and only the blood shall be theirs and shall be given to them. Neither shall my heart be burned before them. Gather the product of this tree," said the maiden.</p>
        <p>The red sap gushing forth from the tree fell in the gourd and with it they made a ball which glistened and took the shape of a heart. The tree gave forth sap similar to blood, with the appearance of real blood. Then the blood, or that is to say the sap of the red tree, clotted, and formed a very bright coating inside the gourd, like clotted blood; meanwhile the tree glowed at the work of the maiden. It was called the "red tree of cochineal," but [since then] it has taken the name of Blood Tree because its sap is called Blood.</p>
        <p>"There on earth you shall be beloved and you shall have all that belongs to you," said the maiden to the owls.</p>
        <p>"Very well, girl. We shall go there, we go up to serve you; you, continue on your way, while we go to present the sap, instead of your heart, to the lords," said the messengers.</p>
        <p>When they arrived in the presence of the lords, all were waiting. "You have finished?" asked Hun-Camé.</p>
        <p>"All is finished, my lords. Here in the bottom of the gourd is the heart."</p>
        <p>"Very well. Let us see," exclaimed Hun-Camé. And grasping it with his fingers he raised it, the shell broke and the blood flowed bright red in color.</p>
        <p>"Stir up the fire and put it on the coals," said Hun-Camé. As soon as they threw it on the fire, the men of Xibalba began to sniff and drawing near to it, they found the fragrance of the heart very sweet.</p>
        <p>And as they sat deep in thought, the owls, the maiden's servants, left, and flew like a flock of birds from the abyss toward earth and the four became her servants. In this manner the Lords of Xibalba were defeated. All were tricked by the maiden.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 4: The Resurrection of the Twins</h2>
        <p>Well, then, Hunbatz and Hunchouén were with their mother when the woman called Xquic arrived. When the woman Xquic came before the mother of Hunbatz and Hunchouén, she carried her sons in her belly and it was not long before Hunahpú and Xbalanqué, as they were called, were to be born.</p>
        <p>When the woman came to the old lady, she said to her: "I have come, mother; I am your daughter-in-law and your daughter, mother." She said this when she entered the grandmother's house.</p>
        <p>"Where did you come from? Where are my sons? Did they, perchance, not die in Xibalba? Do you not see these two who remain, their descendants and blood, and are called Hunbatz and Hunchouén. Go from here! Get out!" the old lady screamed at the girl.</p>
        <p>"Nevertheless, it is true that I am your daughter-in-law; I have been for a long time. I belong to Hun-Hunahpú. They live in what I carry, Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hunahpú are not dead; they will return to show themselves clearly, my mother-in-law. And you shall soon see their image in what I bring to you," she said to the old woman.</p>
        <p>Then Hunbatz and Hunchouén became angry. They did nothing but play the flute and sing, paint, and sculpture all day long and were the consolation of the old woman.</p>
        <p>Then the old woman said: "I do not wish you to be my daughter-in-law, because what you bear in your womb is fruit of your disgrace. Furthermore, you are an impostor; my sons of whom you speak are already dead."</p>
        <p>Presently the grandmother added: "This, that I tell you is the truth; but well, it is all right, you are my daughter-in-law, according to what I have heard. Go, then, bring the food for those who must be fed. Go and gather a large net [full of corn] and return at once, since you are my daughter-in-law, according to what I hear," she said to the girl.</p>
        <p>"Very well," the girl replied, and she went at once to the cornfield which Hunbatz and Hunchouén had planted. They had opened the road and the girl took it and so came to the cornfield; but she found only one stalk of corn; there were not two or three, and when she saw that there was only one stalk with an ear on it, the girl became very anxious.</p>
        <p>"Ah, sinner that I am, unfortunate me! Where must I go to get a net full of corn as she told me to do?" she exclaimed. Immediately she began to beg Chahal for the food which she had to get and must take back.</p>
        <p>"Xtoh, Xcanil, Xcacau, you who cook the corn; and you, Chahal, guardian of the food of Hunbatz and Hunchouén!" said the girl. And then she seized the beards, the red silk of the ears of corn and pulled them off without picking the ear. Then she arranged the silk in the net like ears of corn and the large net was completely filled.</p>
        <p>The girl returned immediately; the animals of the field went along carrying the net, and when they arrived, they went to put the load in a corner of the house, as though she might have carried it. The old woman came and when she saw the corn in the large net she exclaimed: "Where have you brought all this corn from? Did you, perchance, take all the corn in our field and bring it all in? I shall go at once to see," said the old woman, and she set out on the road to the cornfield. But the one stalk of corn was still standing there, and she saw too where the net had been at the foot of the stalk. The old woman quickly returned to the house and embraced the girl: "You are, indeed, my daughter-in-law, for the truth is that the faces of my sons have not been lost; here are their images. These that you bear shall be dear to my heart and to my soul. Here are the children of my sons," she said to the girl.</p>
        <p>Then her children were born and the old woman washed them, and then she laid them in their cradle. Thus Hunahpú and Xbalanqué were born.</p>
        <p>But Hunbatz and Hunchouén were not pleased, for the second time the woman went to bring their food and filled the large net again. She filled it twice and three times, and always the grandmother ate first, and she was pleased to receive her daughter-in-law. At the end of the day the animals carried the net. Then she made more demands of her daughter-in-law and gave orders, as she pleased, to the two boys and the young woman.</p>
        <p>And this they did every day, when the mother of Hunbatz and Hunchouén arrived and returned, she would pull off the silk to fill the large net and always put it down in the corner of the house. But one day they saw their net which had only corn silk in it, and they were filled with anger and rage. They said to their grandmother: "Where does this woman get the large net of corn that she brings every day? Our cornfield is no longer filled with corn; we have nothing to eat."</p>
        <p>"Have patience, my grandchildren; it will surely come," said the old woman.</p>
        <p>"You have been tricked, grandmother, she brings nothing but silk. Our cornfield is empty; our mother gave us our food and what is in the net is only silk. She has cheated us, grandmother," they said to the old woman. And that is the way they discovered that the cornfield was not full of corn, and for that reason they felt great hatred for the boys.</p>
        <p>But Hunahpú and Xbalanqué did not stop hunting or trapping animals or birds. But when they returned, they did not bring the animals; they simply went to hang the animals on the rooftree and they would disappear. They would return in the morning and when they returned there were only their bones. And as the birds were eaten on the rooftree, they only looked at the birds' feathers.</p>
        <p>"Where did these boys go to hunt? Did they shoot their blowguns? They always bring back their load and the fruit of the hunt," said their brothers, and Hunbatz and Hunchouén were very jealous and very envious. They longed only for the destruction of their younger brothers.</p>
        <p>Then they said to them: "Let us go, boys, to the mountains to hunt, so that you may show your worth, and to play our flutes and sing to our hearts' content. Take your flutes," they said, "but do not bring your blowguns." Thus they spoke to them and they set out immediately for the mountains.</p>
        <p>But the only idea they had in mind was to kill their younger brothers in the mountains. They had never loved them; and for that reason Hunbatz and Hunchouén planned to kill them.</p>
        <p>But Hunahpú and Xbalanqué already knew what their older brothers were planning to do to them. But the older brothers did not die when Hunahpú and Xbalanqué turned them into monkeys. First their tails were tied with their heads and arms in the tops of the trees and their faces were changed into monkey faces. This was the punishment for their crimes. Thus were Hunbatz and Hunchouén overcome by Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.</p>
        <p>When Hunahpú and Xbalanqué returned to their grandmother's house, the old woman burst into tears and exclaimed: "Where are they? You must be brave to come back here alone; surely they are dead!"</p>
        <p>"Nevertheless, my grandmother, they are not dead. Do not weep, for here they are, alive," they said, and, pointing to the top of the tree, they showed their older brothers to the old woman. There they were in the tops of the trees, only monkeys; they were scampering over the branches, leaping from tree to tree, howling, and no longer calling out as they did before.</p>
        <p>When the grandmother looked up and saw them, she wept again because of their appearance. "You have destroyed them!" she cried to Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.</p>
        <p>"But we have not destroyed them, our grandmother; they have only changed their appearance. And now, grandmother, do not grieve; they shall be brought back to you. But your grandchildren were wicked and wished to kill us. Nevertheless, we have not destroyed them. Look up and you shall see them in the tops of the trees, their faces just as you see them now, and their homes shall be in the forest," said Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 5: The Ascension of Hunahpú and Xbalanqué to the Sky</h2>
        <p>After this, Hunahpú and Xbalanqué arrived at the foot of the tree which was covered with fruit and said to their grandmother: "What shall be the name of this tree?" They had already heard it was called Hunahpú; but Hunahpú and Xbalanqué said: "This shall be the name of the tree and of all the calabashes, the great gourds which grow on it. We shall call them 'Gourds of Hunahpú,' so this name shall be here among us, and Hunahpú shall not die in the wood; his name shall be in our thoughts and on our lips as long as there are days and nights. The lords of Xibalba shall be destroyed. They shall die, for they have tormented and ruined our grandmother, we shall say. And we shall give these words to our grandmother for her remembrance," said Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.</p>
        <p>Hunahpú and Xbalanqué set out immediately and went to the east of the world. They journeyed for a long time and came to the house of the Sun, where they remained, and there they suffered great pain, for they were forced to live in the midst of the cold, in the dark places of the forest. And finally they reached the palace of the Sun and of the Moon.</p>
        <p>After that, they returned to speak to their grandmother. "We shall go away, our grandmother," they said. "And we shall never come back. But nevertheless, we shall come back to our house every day, and for that reason we must go now. Do not grieve; be glad. We go only to see our father; he shall return here; but do not be frightened if we die," they said, when they took leave of her.</p>
        <p>Then they set out again, and their grandmother saw them on the road as they went and she wept. They went on, then, and descended to Xibalba and said to the Lord Hun-Camé and to the Lord Vucub-Camé: "We are here to say that we come to play ball with you, Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé."</p>
        <p>"Very well," they replied. "Let us play," and at the same time the match began between the Lords of Xibalba and Hunahpú and Xbalanqué. The Lords of Xibalba lost, and lost again; they were beaten. The Lords of Xibalba were defeated.</p>
        <p>"Let us kill them, then," said the Lords of Xibalba. "Let us put them in the House of Blades, in Chayim-há, so that they shall perish, so that they shall die." They talked among themselves and then went away, saying that they would kill them.</p>
        <p>"It is not necessary that we die, Lord," they said to Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé. "Be it known that we have not come here in vain. We have come to overcome you, because you have neither honor nor pride. You are condemned to misfortune. When we cut you down, we shall cut you up like a bunch of flowers," said the boys. Then Hunahpú and Xbalanqué disappeared from their sight.</p>
        <p>But after that, when the day came, they reappeared; they returned to say: "We shall see whether you do us any harm, whether you destroy us, whether you put us to death. Here we are, ready to die by fire or by drowning, we do not fear it."</p>
        <p>"Let it be done, then. Put them to death, our Lords," they said. "Tomorrow they shall be sacrificed," said all the Lords of Xibalba. Immediately they were put to death, and then the Lords of Xibalba rejoiced.</p>
        <p>Afterwards, they buried their bones in Pucbal-Chah. They ground their bones, they powdered them, and the powder was sprinkled into the river and the waters carried them away. The Lords of Xibalba rejoiced at their destruction and said: "They shall never appear again, nor shall they be powerful again, the boys called Hunahpú and Xbalanqué. Now the days and the nights shall be ours. So be it, then, Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé, as it was agreed upon," they said.</p>
        <p>But when they had gone, their bones, ground to powder, did not go far. They settled down in the middle of the river, and after that they were not seen again, nor were they noticed.</p>
        <p>But on the fifth day they appeared again; they reappeared as though nothing had been done to them. They were seen in the middle of the water by the sons of the men who lived in that place, and they were seen again on the shore by all the people of Xibalba.</p>
        <p>"What can this be? They came to dance the 'Bite of the Serpent,' the 'Blow of the Jaguar,' the 'Fire of the Bat,' the 'Dance of the Mosquito,' the 'Iguana,' the 'Frog,' the 'King Vulture,' and the 'Dance of the Poorwill,' as they were called. And they danced, and all Xibalba gathered to see them. They danced, then, and everybody was happy as they watched. Then they struck the bite of the serpent, the blow of the jaguar, the fire of the bat, the dance of the mosquito, and the dance of the iguana and of the frog. With the spectators standing around, they struck their bodies with their hands and with their feet and wriggled around as though they were really biting themselves and really tearing themselves apart.</p>
        <p>And so they danced, and it really seemed that they cut themselves open; their bones fell apart, their arms and their legs separated, but they were not wounded, they were whole again and again. And they burned everything, as though they were really burning, and really their bodies appeared to be reduced to ashes, as though they were really reduced to ashes by the fire, but again they were alive.</p>
        <p>Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé looked at them with surprise, and marveled at what they did. They were filled with amazement, and said: "Perform the dance of the poorwill, too," they said. And they replied: "No," because they had not come for that purpose.</p>
        <p>"Kill us! Burn us, and we shall truly be reduced to ashes. Afterwards, revive us," they said to Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé. Then the boys were really killed, their bodies were cut up and were really reduced to ashes.</p>
        <p>And again they lived, and were whole, and having done this, Hunahpú and Xbalanqué offered to do the same thing to others.</p>
        <p>"Do the same to us!" the lords said, offering themselves, "and you shall make us young again, truly young men, and we shall be truly content, then," they said to them. Then they sacrificed the two lords, Hun-Camé and Vucub-Camé, and did not revive them afterwards, for the sacrifice was not for their good; they did not come back to life. Thus both of the Lords of Xibalba were destroyed.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 6: The Creation of the Maize People</h2>
        <p>THEN they called together all the Lords of Xibalba: Chamiabac, Chamiaholom, Xiquiripat, Cuchumaquic, Ahalpuh, Ahalganá, Chamiabac, Chamiaholom, and Xic, Patán, Quic-Xic, Quicré, Camé, Holom, Cuchi, Avil, and Molong. And all of them humbled themselves before Hunahpú and Xbalanqué.</p>
        <p>Then they confessed their evil deeds: "We were just testing them; they came here just to dance before us and to take pleasure in our torments. Forgive us, for we shall give up our lands and wealth and give them to you," they said.</p>
        <p>Then they made them kneel down and put their feet on the necks of all the people of Xibalba, so that they were completely conquered. And when they had made them kneel, all of Xibalba was in the hands of the boys. In this way the people of Xibalba were destroyed and they lost their grandeur and power, and their scepters and their crowns were destroyed.</p>
        <p>And immediately after that, the boys ascended to the sky, they rose up in the middle of the light, and then the four corners of the earth came to meet and embrace each other. Thus the dawn of humanity was born, and the people of the earth came into being.</p>
        <p>Now there were four men, and each of them possessed a different light. They were truly gifted men; they were the four cornerstones of the earth; they were the first men created.</p>
        <p>The names of the first men were Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Agab, Mahucutah, and Iqi-Balam. These were the names of the four men who were created. And there were no other men then, except those who were created. Neither were there any women. They existed only in the thoughts and words of the Creators, of the Forefathers.</p>
        <p>Then they looked up and their gaze turned to the heavens, and their vision extended over the entire world. And when they had looked at the earth, they gave thanks to the Creator and the Maker: "Truly, we give you thanks, Huracán, Chipi-Caculhá, and Raxa-Caculhá," they said, "for we have been created, we have been given life, we speak, we walk, we hear, and we know what is far and what is near. Truly, we see the great and small things of the sky and the earth. Thanks to you, we have been created; thanks to you, we have been given our mouths, our faces, and our hearts. We are able to speak, to hear, to move, to walk, and to think. We are created perfectly; thanks to you, we exist, Creator, Maker, and Forefathers," they said, when they gave thanks for having been created and endowed with perfect life and perfect humanity.</p>
        <p>And thus they spoke, and the Creator and Maker heard them. And when they had looked at everything, their wisdom was complete, their vision passed over the trees and the rocks, over the lakes and the seas, over the mountains and the valleys. Truly, they were gifted men.</p>
        <p>Then they began to multiply; men existed and walked on the roads and paths, and their thoughts turned to their Mother and Father. And the Creator and Maker knew it.</p>
        <p>Then they took counsel again: "What shall we do now with them? Let their sight reach only that which is near; let them see only a little of the face of the earth! Look! Are they not merely 'works' and 'designs' in their very being? Must they also be gods?"</p>
        <p>And as they spoke, the Heart of Heaven blew mist into their eyes, which clouded their sight as when a mirror is breathed upon. Their eyes were covered and they could see only what was close, only that which was clear to them. In this way the wisdom and all the knowledge of the four men, the origin and beginning [of the Quiché race], were destroyed.</p>
        <p>Thus were created and formed our ancestors by the Heart of Heaven, Heart of Earth.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 7: The First Dawn</h2>
        <p>AFTER that, they multiplied; the first men were men, the first women were women. They lived together, and the people multiplied. But before the sun and the moon had risen, it was night. The sun had not yet appeared, but at last the sun appeared above the horizon. This is the story of how they found their places and how they saw the sun when it rose. And it happened like this: As they stood there on the mountain, a great fire appeared. They were standing in the mountains, at a place called "Mountain Place."</p>
        <p>All the tribes were there, and they had all come together; but they had no means to speak with each other, nor did they know what was happening. But suddenly the sun rose, and the mountains shone red with the light. And when the sun appeared, there was great joy, for it was the first time the sun had shone on the tribes.</p>
        <p>Then they offered their incense and sang praises to the gods, and the smoke of their offerings filled the air. And the sun rose higher and higher, and the people stood still, gazing up at the light. They were silent, and they had no words, but their hearts were full of joy, for they had seen the light and it was good.</p>
        <p>And when the sun was high in the sky, they knew that the night was over, and the people rejoiced, for it was the first dawn, the first morning. They sang, they danced, and they gave thanks to the Creator and the Maker, for the sun had risen, and the day had come.</p>
        <p>Thus ended the night, and thus began the day, the first day of the new world.</p>
        <p>And the people multiplied, and they spread out over the earth, and they built their homes and their cities. They planted their fields, and they harvested their crops. They lived in peace and prosperity, and they gave thanks to the gods for their blessings.</p>
        <p>And so the world was created, and so it was filled with life, and so it was made beautiful by the hand of the Creator and the Maker. And the people lived in harmony with the earth and with each other, and they were happy, for they had seen the light, and it was good.</p>
        <p>Thus ends the story of the creation, the story of the first dawn, the story of the beginning of the world.</p>

        <h1>PART III:</h1>

        <h2>Chapter 1: The Establishment of the Lineages</h2>
        <p>Here, then is the beginning of when it was decided to make man, and when what must enter into the flesh of man was sought. And the Forefathers, the Creators and Makers, who were called Tepeu and Gucumatz said: "The time of dawn has come, let the work be finished, and let those who are to nourish and sustain us appear, the noble sons, the civilized vassals; let man appear, humanity, on the face of the earth." Thus they spoke.</p>
        <p>They assembled, came together and held council in the darkness and in the night; then they sought and discussed, and here they reflected and thought. In this way their decisions came dearly to light and they found and discovered what must enter into the flesh of man. It was just before the sun, the moon, and the stars appeared over the Creators and Makers.</p>
        <p>From Paxil, from Cayalá, as they were called, came the yellow ears of corn and the white ears of corn. These are the names of the animals which brought the food: yac (the mountain cat), utiú (the coyote), quel (a small parrot), and hoh (the crow). These four animals gave tidings of the yellow ears of corn and the white ears of corn, they told them that they should go to Paxil and they showed them the road to Paxil.</p>
        <p>And thus they found the food, and this was what went into the flesh of created man, the made man; this was his blood; of this the blood of man was made. So the corn entered [into the formation of man] by the work of the Forefathers. And in this way they were filled with joy, because they had found a beautiful land, full of pleasures, abundant in ears of yellow corn and ears of white corn, and abundant also in pataxte and cacao, and in innumerable zapotes, anonas, jocotes, nantzes, matasanos, and honey. There was an abundance of delicious food in those villages called Paxil and Cayalá.</p>
        <p>There were foods of every kind, small and large foods, small plants and large plants. The animals showed them the road. And then grinding the yellow corn and the white corn, Xmucané made nine drinks, and from this food came the strength and the flesh, and with it they created the muscles and the strength of man. This the Forefathers did, Tepeu and Gucumatz, as they were called. After that they began to talk about the creation and the making of our first mother and father; of yellow corn and of white corn they made their flesh; of corn-meal dough they made the arms and the legs of man. Only dough of corn meal went into the flesh of our first fathers, the four men, who were created.</p>
        
        <h2>Chapter 2: The Reign of the Quiché Kings</h2>
        <p>These are the names of the first men who were created and formed: the first man was Balam-Quitzé, the second, Balam-Acab, the third, Mahucutah, and the fourth was Iqui-Balam. These are the names of our first mothers and fathers.</p>
        <p>It is said that they only were made and formed, they had no mother, they had no father. They were only called men. They were not born of woman, nor were they begotten by the Creator nor by the Maker, nor by the Forefathers. Only by a miracle, by means of incantation were they created and made by the Creator, the Maker, the Forefathers, Tepeu and Gucumatz. And as they had the appearance of men, they were men; they talked, conversed, saw and heard, walked, grasped things; they were good and handsome men, and their figure was the figure of a man.</p>
        <p>They were endowed with intelligence; they saw and instantly they could see far, they succeeded in seeing, they succeeded in knowing all that there is in the world. When they looked, instantly they saw all around them, and they contemplated in turn the arch of heaven and the round face of the earth. The things hidden [in the distance] they saw all, without first having to move; at once they saw the world, and so, too, from where they were, they saw it.</p>
        <p>Great was their wisdom; their sight reached to the forests, the rocks, the lakes, the seas, the mountains, and the valleys. In truth, they were admirable men. Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam. Then the Creator and the Maker asked them: "What do you think of your condition? Do you not see? Do you not hear? Are not your speech and manner of walking good? Look, then! Contemplate the world, look [and see] if the mountains and the valleys appear! Try, then, to see!" they said to [the four first men].</p>
        <p>And immediately they [the four first men] began to see all that was in the world. Then they gave thanks to the Creator and the Maker: "We really give you thanks, two and three times! We have been created, we have been given a mouth and a face, we speak, we hear, we think, and walk; we feel perfectly, and we know what is far and what is near. We also see the large and the small in the sky and on earth. We give you thanks, then, for having created us, oh, Creator and Maker! for having given us being, oh, our grandmother! oh, our grandfather!" they said, giving thanks for their creation and formation.</p>
        
        <h2>Chapter 3: The Migration of the Tribes</h2>
        <p>Then their wives had being, and their women were made. God himself made them carefully. And so, during sleep, they came, truly beautiful, their women, at the side of Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam. There were their women when they awakened, and instantly their hearts were filled with joy because of their wives.</p>
        <p>Here are the names of their wives: Cahá-Paluna was the name of the wife of Balam-Quitzé; Chomihá was the wife of Balam-Acab; Tzununihá, the wife of Mahucutah; and Caquixahá was the name of the wife of Iqui-Balam. These are the names of their wives, who were distinguished women. They conceived the men, of the small tribes and of the large tribes, and were the origin of us; the people of Quiché.</p>
        <p>There were many priests and sacrificers; there were not only four, but those four were the Forefathers of us, the people of the Quiché. The names of each one were different when they multiplied there in the East, and there were many names of the people: Tepeu, Olomán, Cohah, Quenech, Ahau, as they called those men there in the East, where they multiplied. The beginning is known, too, of those of Tamub and those of Ilocab who came together from there in the East.</p>
        <p>Balam-Quitzé was the grandfather and the father of the nine great houses of the Cavec; Balam-Acab was the grandfather and father of the nine great houses of the Nimhaib; Mahucutah, the grandfather and father of the four great houses of Ahau-Quiché. Three groups of families existed; but they did not forget the name of their grandfather and father, those who propagated and multiplied there in the East. The Tamub and Ilocab also came, and thirteen branches of peoples, the thirteen of Tecpán, and those of Rabinal, the Cakchiquel, those from Tziquinahá, and the Zacahá and the Lamaq, Cumatz, Tuhalhá, Uchabahá, those of Chumilahá, those of Quibahá, of Batenabá, Acul-Vinac, Balamihá, the Canchahel, and Balam-Colob. These are only the principal tribes, the branches of the people which we mention; only of the principal ones shall we speak. Many others came from each group of the people, but we shall not write their names. They also multiplied there in the East. Many men were made and in the darkness they multiplied. Neither the sun nor the light had yet been made when they multiplied. All lived together, they existed in great number and walked there in the East.</p>
        
        <h2>Chapter 4: The Arrival in the Land of Quiché</h2>
        <p>Nevertheless, they did not sustain nor maintain [their God]; they only raised their faces to the sky, and they did not know why they had come so far as they did. There they were then, in great number, the black men and the white men, men of many classes, men of many tongues, that it was wonderful to hear them. There are generations in the world, there are country people, whose faces we do not see, who have no homes, they only wander through the small and large woodlands, like crazy people. So it is said scornfully of the people of the wood. So they said there, where they saw the rising of the sun.</p>
        <p>The speech of all was the same. They did not invoke wood nor stone, and they remembered the word of the Creator and the Maker, the Heart of Heaven, the Heart of Earth. In this manner they spoke, while they thought about the coming of the dawn. And they raised their prayers, those worshipers of the word [of God], loving, obedient. and fearful, raising their faces to the sky when they asked for daughters and sons:</p>
        <p>"Oh thou, Tzacol, Bitol! Look at us, hear us! Do not leave us, do not forsake us, oh, God, who art in heaven and on earth, Heart of Heaven, Heart of Earth! Give us our descendants, our succession, as long as the sun shall move and there shall be light. Let it dawn; let the day come! Give us many good roads, flat roads! May the people have peace, much peace, and may they be happy; and give us good life and useful existence! Oh, thou Huracán, Chipi-Caculhá, Raxá-Caculhá, Chipi-Nanauac, Raxá-Nanauac, Voc, Hunahpú, Tepeu, Gucumatz, Alom, Qaholom, Xpiyacoc, Xmucané, grandmother of the sun, grandmother of the light, let there be dawn, and let the light come!"</p>
        
        <h2>Chapter 5: The Foundation of the City of Utatlán</h2>
        <p>Then their hearts were filled with joy because of the sun, the moon, and the stars. Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam said, "Let us await the break of day." So said those great wise men, the enlightened men, the priests and sacrificers. This they said.</p>
        <p>Our first mothers and fathers did not yet have wood nor stones to keep; but their hearts were tired of waiting for the sun. Already all the tribes and the Yaqui people, the priests and sacrificers, were very many. "Let us go, let us go to search and see if our [tribal] symbols are in safety; if we can find what we must burn before them. For being as we are, there is no one who watches for us," said Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam. And having heard of a city, they went there.</p>
        <p>Now then, the name of the place where Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam and those of Tamub and Ilocab went was Tulán-Zuivá, Vucub-Pec, Vucub-Ziván. This was the name of the city where they went to receive their gods.</p>
        <p>So, then, all arrived at Tulán. It was impossible to count the men who arrived; there were very many and they walked in an orderly way. Then was the appearance of their gods; first those of Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam who were filled with joy: "At last we have found that for which we searched!" they said. And the first that appeared was Tohil, as this god was called, and Balam-Quitzé put him on his back, in his chest. Instantly the god called Avilix appeared, and Balam-Acab carried him. The god called Hacavitz was carried by Mahucutah; and Iqui-Balam carried the one called Nicahtacah.</p>
        
        <h2>Chapter 6: The Great Council of the Quiché</h2>
        <p>There was nevertheless a tribe who stole the fire in the smoke; and they were from the house of Zotzil. The god of the Cakchiquel was called Chamalcán and he had the form of a bat. When they passed through the smoke, they went softly and then they seized the fire. The Cakchiquel did not ask for the fire, because they did not want to give themselves up to be overcome, the way that the other tribes had been overcome when they offered their breasts and their armpits so that they would be opened. And this was the opening [of the breasts] about which Tohil had spoken; that they should sacrifice all the tribes before him, that they should tear out their hearts from their breasts. And this had not yet begun when the taking of power and sovereignty by Balam-Quitzé, Balam.-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam was prophesied by Tohil.</p>
        <p>There in Tulán-Zuivá, whence they had come, they were accustomed to fast, they observed a perpetual fast while they awaited the coming of dawn and watched for the rising sun. They took turns at watching the Great Star called Icoquih, which rises first before the sun, when the sun rises, the brilliant Icoquih, which was always before them in the East, when they were there in the place called Tulán-Zuivá, whence came their god. It was not here, then, where they received their power and sovereignty, but there they subdued and subjected the large and small tribes when they sacrificed them before Tohil, and offered him the blood, the substance, breasts, and sides of all the men.</p>
        
        <h2>Chapter 7: The Inheritance of the Quiché Kingdom</h2>
        <p>They came at last to the top of a mountain and there all the Quiché people and the tribes were reunited. There they all held council to make their plans. Today this mountain is called Chi-Pixab, this is the name of the mountain. There they reunited and there they extolled themselves: "I am, I, the people of the Quiché! And thou, Tamub, that shall be thy name." And to those from Ilocab they said: "Thou, Ilocab, this shall be thy name. And these three Quiché [peoples] shall not disappear, our fate is the same," they said when they gave them their names.</p>
        <p>Then they gave the Cakchiquel their name: Gagchequeleb was their name. In the same way they named those of Rabinal, which was their name, and they still have it. And also those of Tziquinahá, as they are called today. Those are the names which they gave to each other.</p>
        <p>There they were come together to await the dawn and to watch for the coming of the star, which comes just before the sun, when it is about to rise. "We came from there, but we have separated," they said to each other. And their hearts were troubled; they were suffering greatly; they did not have food; they did not have sustenance; they only smelled the ends of their staffs and thus they imagined they were eating; but they did not eat when they came.</p>
        <p>It is not quite clear, however, how they crossed the sea; they crossed to this side, as if there were no sea; they crossed on stones, placed in a row over the sand. For this reason they were called Stones in a Row, Sand Under the Sea, names given to them when they [the tribes] crossed the sea, the waters having parted when they passed.</p>
        <p>And their hearts were troubled when they talked together, because they had nothing to eat, only a drink of water and a handful of corn they had. There they were, then, assembled on the mountain called Chi-Pixab. And they had also brought Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz. Balam-Quitzé and his wife Cahá-Paluna, which was the name of his wife, observed a complete fast. And so did Balam-Acab and his wife, who was called Chomihá; and Mahucutah and his wife, called Tzununihá, also observed a complete fast, and Iqui-Balam. with his wife, called Caquixahá, likewise. And there were those who fasted in the darkness, and in the night. Great was their sorrow when they were on the mountain, called Chi-Pixab.</p>
        
        <h1>PART IV:</h1>

        <h2>Chapter 1: The Establishment of the Nations</h2>
        <p>NOW, THEN, MANY TOWNS WERE BEING founded, one by one, and the different branches of the tribes were being reunited and settled close to the roads, their roads which they had opened.</p>
        <p>As for Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam, it was not known where they were. But when they saw the tribes that passed on the roads, instantly they began to shout on the mountain-tops, howling like a coyote, screaming like a mountain cat, and imitating the roaring of the puma and the jaguar.</p>
        <p>And the tribes seeing these things, as they walked, said: "Their screams are like those of the coyote, of the mountain cat, of the puma, and of the jaguar. They want to appear to the tribes as though they are not men, and they only do this to deceive us, we the people. Their hearts wish something. Surely, they do not frighten us with what they do. They mean something with the roaring of the puma, with the noise of the jaguar which they break into when they see one or two men walking; what they want is to make an end of us."</p>
        <p>Every day they [the priests] came to their houses and to their women, carrying only the young of the bumblebees and the wasps, and the honeybees to give to their women.</p>
        <p>Every day, too, they came before Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz and said in their hearts: "Here are Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz. We can offer them only the blood of the deer and the birds; we take only blood from our ears and our arms. Let us ask Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz for strength and vigor. What will [the tribes] say about the deaths of the people, which, one by one, we are killing?" they said to one another as they went into the presence of Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz.</p>
        <p>Then they punctured their ears and their arms before the divinities; they caught their blood and put it in a vase near the stones. They were not really stones, but each one appeared in the likeness of a youth.</p>
        <p>They were happy with the blood of the priests and sacrificers when they arrived with this example of their work.</p>
        <p>"Follow their tracks [those of the animals which they sacrificed], there is your salvation! "From there, from Tulán, whence you brought us," they were told, "came the skin, called Pazilizib, which was given to you, smeared with blood: spill your blood and let this be the offering of Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz."</p>
        
        <h2>Chapter 2: The Story of King Gucumatz</h2>
        <p>Here is how Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam began the abduction of the men of the tribes [of Vuc Amag].</p>
        <p>Then came the killing of the tribes. They seized a man as he walked alone, or two when they were walking together, and it was not known when they were seized, and then they went to sacrifice them before Tohil. and Avilix. Afterward they sprinkled the blood on the road and placed the heads separately on the road. And the tribes said, "The jaguar ate them." And they spoke thus because like footprints of the jaguar were the tracks which they had left, although they did not show themselves.</p>
        <p>Already, many were the men who had been carried off, but the tribes did not notice it until later. "Could it be Tohil. and Avilix who have been here among us? It must be they who are nourished by the priests and the sacrificers. Where are their homes? Let us follow their footprints!" said all the people.</p>
        <p>Then they held a council among themselves. Then they began to follow the footprints of the priests and the sacrificers, but they were not clear. There were only tracks of wild animals, tracks of jaguars that they saw, but the tracks were not distinct. The first ones were not clear because they were reversed, as though made so that the people went astray, and their way was not clear. A mist formed, a black rain fell and made much mud; and it began to drizzle. This was what the people saw before them. And their hearts became weary of searching and following them on the roads, because the beings of Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz were so great that the latter withdrew to the summit of the mountains, in the vicinity of the people, whom they killed.</p>
        <p>Thus began the abduction of the people when the sorcerers caught the tribes in the roads and sacrificed them before Tohil. Avilix, and Hacavitz; but their [own] sons they saved there on the mountain.</p>
        <p>Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz had the appearance of three youths and walked by virtue of the magic stone. There was a river in which they bathed, at the edge of the water and only there did they appear. For this reason it was called "in the Bathing Place of Tohil," and this was the name of the river. Often the tribes saw them, but they disappeared immediately, when they were seen by the people.</p>
        <p>Then they had tidings of where Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah. and Iqui-Balam were, and at once the tribes held council as to the way in which they could be killed.</p>
        <p>In the first place the tribes wanted to discuss the way to overcome Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz. And all the priests and sacrificers [of the tribes] said to the people: "Arise, all of you, call everyone, let there be not one group, nor two groups, among us who remain behind the others."</p>
        <p>All assembled, they assembled in great numbers and deliberated among themselves. And they said, asking each other: "What shall we do to overcome the Quiché of Cavec by whose hands our sons and vassals are being killed? it is not known how our people are being destroyed. If we must perish, because of these abductions, so let it be; and if the power of Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz is so great then let our god be this Tohil, and God grant that you take him captive. It is not possible that they shall overcome us. Are there not, perchance, enough men among us? And the Cavec are not many," they said, when all were assembled.</p>
        <p>And some said, turning to the tribes, when they spoke: "Who has seen those who bathe in the river every day? If they are Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz, then we shall overcome them first, and afterward, we shall begin the destruction of the priests and sacrificers." This, many of them said, when they talked.</p>
        <p>"But how shall we overcome them?" they asked again.</p>
        <p>"This shall be our way of overcoming them. Since they have the appearance of youths when they let themselves be seen in the water, then let two maidens who are really beautiful, and very lovely, go and provoke in them desire to possess them," they said.</p>
        <p>"Very well. Let us go, then; let us find two beautiful maidens," they exclaimed, and then they went to find their daughters. And truly beautiful were the maidens.</p>
        <p>Then they instructed the maidens: "Go, our daughters, go to wash clothes at the river, and if you see the three youths, undress before them, and if their hearts desire you, call to them. If they say to you, 'May we come to you?' answer, 'Yes.' And when they ask: 'Where do you come from, whose daughters are you?' tell them, 'We are daughters of the lords.'</p>
        <p>"Then you shall say: 'Give us a token of yours.' And if after they have given you something, they want to kiss your faces, really give yourselves to them. And if you do not give yourselves to them, we shall kill you. Afterward our hearts shall be satisfied. When you have the token, bring it here, and this shall be proof, in our judgment, that they were joined with you."</p>
        <p>Thus spoke the lords when they advised the two maidens. Here are their names: Xtah was the name of one of the maidens, and the other was Xpuch. And the two maidens, Xtah and Xpuch, were sent to the river, to the bathing place of Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz. This is what was decided by all the tribes.</p>
        <p>They went at once, well adorned, and they were truly very beautiful when they went there where Tohil was bathing, so that they would be seen, when they were washing. When they went, the lords were happy because they had sent their two daughters.</p>
        <p>As soon as the latter arrived at the river, they began to wash. The two had already taken off their clothes and were bending over the stones when Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz came. They came there to the edge of the river and paused a moment, surprised to see the two young girls who were washing, and the girls became ashamed at the moment when Tohil came. But the two girls did not appeal to Tohil. And then he asked them: "Where did you come from?" Thus he asked the two maidens, and added: "What do you want that you come here to the edge of our water?"</p>
<p>And they answered: "The lords have sent us to come here. 'Go look at the faces of Tohil and speak with them,' the lords told us; and 'then bring proof that you have seen their faces.' they told us." Thus the two girls spoke, making known the purpose of their coming.</p>
<p>Well, what the tribes wanted was that the two maidens would be violated by the incarnation of Tohil. But Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz said, speaking again to Xtah and Xpuch, as the two maidens were called: "Very well, with you shall go proof of our conversation. Wait a little and then you shall give it to the lords." they said.</p>
<p>Then they held council with the priests and sacrificers and they said to Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam: "Paint three capes, paint on them the symbol of your being in order that it may be recognized by the tribes, when the maidens who are washing carry them back. Give the capes to them," Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, and Mahucutah were told.</p>
<p>At once the three began to paint. First, Balam-Quitzé painted a jaguar; the figure was made and painted on the surface of the cape. Then Balam-Acab painted the figure of an eagle on the surface of a cape; and then Mahucutah painted bumblebees and wasps all over, figures and drawings of which he painted on the cloth. And the three finished their painting, three pieces they painted.</p>
<p>Then they went to give the capes to Xtah and Xpuch, as they were called, and Balam-Quitzé. Balam-Acab, and Mahucutah said to them: "Here is proof of your conversation [with us]; take these before the lords: Say to them, 'In truth, Tohil has talked to us; here we bring the proof,' tell them, and have them dress themselves in the clothes which you will give them." This they told the maidens when they bade them farewell. The latter went at once, carrying the above-mentioned painted capes.</p>
<p>When they arrived, the lords were filled with joy to see their faces and their hands, from which hung the things the maidens had gone for.</p>
<p>"Did you see the face of Tohil?" they asked them.</p>
<p>"Yes, we saw it," answered Xtah and Xpuch.</p>
<p>"Very well. And you bring the token, do you not?" the lords asked, thinking that this was the proof of their sin.</p>
<p>Then the maidens held out the painted capes, all covered with [the figures] of jaguars and eagles, and covered with bumblebees and wasps, painted on the surface of the cloth and which shone before them. At once they felt a desire to put the capes on.</p>
<p>The jaguar did nothing when the lord threw the first painting on his back. Then the lord put on the second painting, with the figure of the eagle. The lord felt very well wrapped within it. And he turned about before all of them.</p>
<p>Then he undressed before all, and put on the third painted cape. And now he had on himself, the bumblebees and wasps which were on it. Instantly the bumblebees and the wasps stung his flesh. And not being able to suffer the stings of these insects, he began to scream because of the insects whose figures were painted on the cloth, the painting of Mahucutah, which was the third one that had been painted.</p>
<p>Thus they were overcome. Then the lords reprimanded the two maidens named Xtah and Xpuch: "What kind of clothes are those which you have brought? Where did you go to bring them, you devils?" they said to the maidens when they reprimanded them. All the people were overcome by Tohil.</p>
<p>Well, what they [the lords] wanted was that Tohil should have gone to amuse himself with Xtah and Xpuch, and that the [maidens] would have become whores, for the tribes believed that they would serve to tempt them. But it was not possible that they should overcome them, thanks to those miraculous men, Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam.</p>
<h2>Chapter 3: The Genealogy of the Kings of Quiché</h2>
<p>Afterwards the tribes held council again.</p>
<p>"What shall we do with them? in truth, their estate is very great," they said when they assembled again in council.</p>
<p>"Well, then, we shall waylay them, we shall kill them, we shall arm ourselves with bows and with shields. Perchance, are we not many? Let there not be one or two among us who remains behind." This they said when they held council. And all the people armed. Many were the warriors when all the people gathered together for the killing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there were Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam, they were on the mountain Hacavitz, on the hill of this name. They were there in order to save their sons who were on the mountain.</p>
<p>And they did not have many people, they did not have multitudes such as the multitudes of the tribes. The summit of the mountain where they had their place was small, and for that reason when the tribes assembled together and rose, they decided to kill all of them.</p>
<p>In this manner, then, took place the reunion of all the people, all armed with their bows and their shields. It is impossible to describe the richness of their arms; the appearance of all the chiefs and men was very beautiful, and certainly all obeyed their orders.</p>
<p>"They shall positively be destroyed, and as for Tohil. he shall be our god, we shall worship him, if we take him prisoner," they said to each other. But Tohil knew everything and so did Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, and Mahucutah. They heard all the plans, because they did not sleep, or rest, from the time the warriors armed themselves.</p>
<p>Then all the warriors rose up and started out on the road, intending to enter [the town] by night. But they did not arrive, for all the warriors were watching on the road, and then they were destroyed by Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, and Mahucutah.</p>
<p>All remained watching along the road, but they heard nothing and they finally fell asleep.</p>
<p>Then they [Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, and Mahucutah] began to pull out their eyelashes and their beards; they took off the metal ornaments from their throats--their crowns and necklaces. And they took the metal from the handles of their spears. They did this to punish them and humiliate them, and give them an example of the power of the Quiché people.</p>
<p>When they [the warriors] awoke, they wanted to take their crowns and their staffs, but they no longer had metal in the staff-handles, nor their crowns. "Who has stripped us? Who has torn out our beards? Whence have they come to rob us of our precious metals?" said all of the warriors. "Can it be these devils who are carrying off the men? But they shall not succeed in frightening us. We shall enter their town by force, and we shall again see the face of our silver; this we shall do," said all the tribes, and all truly intended to carry out their word.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the hearts of the priests and the sacrificers on the summit of the mountain were calm. And Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam having talked together, they built a wall at the edge of the town and enclosed it with boards and thorns. Then they made figures in the form of men, and put them in rows on the wall, armed them with shields and arrows and adorned them, putting metal crowns on their heads. These they put on the simple wooden figures, they adorned them with the metal which they had taken from the tribes on the road and with them they decorated the figures.</p>
<p>They made a moat around the town, and then they asked advice of Tohil: "Shall they kill us? Shall they overcome us?" their hearts said to Tohil.</p>
<p>"Do not be troubled! I am here. And this you will use. Do not be afraid," he [Tohil] said to Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam, when they were given the bumblebees and the wasps. This is what they went to fetch. And when they came, they put them inside four big gourds which were placed around the town. They shut the bumblebees and wasps inside the gourds, in order to fight the people with them.</p>
<p>The city was watched from afar, spied upon and observed by the scouts of the tribes. "They are not many," they said. But they saw only the wooden figures which lightly moved their bows and their shields. In truth, they had the appearance of men, had in truth the appearance of warriors when the tribes looked at them, and all the tribes were happy because they saw that they were not many.</p>
<p>There were many tribes; it was not possible to count the people, the warriors and soldiers who were going to kill Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, and Mahucutah, who were on the mountain Hacavitz, the name of the place where they were found.</p>
<p>Now we shall tell about their arrival.</p>
<h2>Chapter 4: The Prophecy of the Fall of the Quiché Kingdom</h2>
<p>They were there, then, Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam, were all together on the mountain with their wives and their children when all the warriors and soldiers came. The tribes did not number sixteen thousand, or twenty-four thousand men, [but even more].</p>
<p>They surrounded the town, crying out loudly, armed with arrows and shields, beating drums, giving war whoops, whistling, shouting, inciting them to fight, when they arrived in front of the town.</p>
<p>But the priests and sacrificers were not frightened; they only looked at them from the edge of the wall, where they were in good order with their wives and children. They thought only of the strength and the shouting of the tribes when they came up the side of the mountain.</p>
<p>Shortly before they were about to throw themselves at the entrance of the town, the four gourds which were at the edge of the town were opened and the bumblebees and the wasps came out of the gourds; like a great cloud of smoke they emerged from the gourds. And thus the warriors perished because of the insects which stung the pupils of their eyes and fastened themselves to their noses, their mouths, their legs, and their arms. "Where are they," they said, "those who went to get and bring in all the bumblebees and wasps that are here?"</p>
<p>They went straight to sting the pupils of their eyes, the little insects buzzing in swarms over each one of the men; and the latter, stunned by the bumblebees and wasps, could no longer grasp their bows and their shields, which were broken on the ground.</p>
<p>When the warriors fell, they were stretched out on the mountainside, and they no longer felt when they were hit with arrows, and wounded by the axes. Balam-Quitzé and Balam-Acab used only blunt sticks. Their wives also took part in this killing. Only a part [of them] returned and all the tribes began to flee. But the first ones caught were put to death; not a few of the men died, and those who died were not the ones they intended to kill but those who were attacked by the insects. Neither was it a deed of valor, because the warriors were not killed by arrows or by shields.</p>
<p>Then all the tribes surrendered. The people humbled themselves before Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, and Mahucutah. "Have pity on us, do not kill us," they exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Very well. Although you deserve to die, you shall [instead] become [our] vassals for the rest of your lives," they said to them.</p>
<p>In this way were all of the tribes destroyed by our first mothers and fathers; and this happened there on the mountain Hacavitz, as it is now called. This was where they first settled, where they multiplied and increased, begot their daughters, gave being to their sons, on the mountain Hacavitz.</p>
<p>They were, then, very happy when they had overcome all the tribes, whom they destroyed there on the mountaintop. In this way they carried out the destruction of the tribes, of all the tribes. After this their hearts rested. And they said to their sons that when they [the tribes] intended to kill them, the hour of their own death was approaching.</p>
<p>And now we shall tell of the death of Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Acab, Mahucutah, and Iqui-Balam, as they were called.</p>

<h2>The Fall of Gumarcaah and the Quiché Kingdom</h2>

<p>Gumarcaah, the city of the mighty Quiché, stood tall in the highlands, its temples and palaces gleaming in the sun. But the prophecies spoke of a time when the power of the Quiché would wane, and the foreign invaders would arrive from across the sea.</p>

<p>The rulers of the Quiché were warned by the ancient seers, who spoke of the downfall that was to come. Yet, the Quiché lords, in their pride, believed their city impregnable, their warriors unbeatable.</p>

<p>But when the Spaniards arrived, led by Pedro de Alvarado, the Quiché realized too late the power of the new invaders. The might of the Quiché warriors, their bows, and arrows, their spears and shields, were no match for the weapons of iron and fire brought by the Spaniards.</p>

<p>Gumarcaah fell, and with it, the kingdom of the Quiché. The last of the great kings were captured, their sovereignty stripped away as they were forced to submit to the new rulers. The temples were desecrated, the gods of the Quiché were silenced, and the people were subjugated under the rule of the foreign lords.</p>

<h2>The Genealogy of the Final Kings</h2>

<p>The line of the Quiché kings ended with Don Juan de Rojas and Don Juan Cortés, the sons of Tecum and Tepepul. These were the last kings to hold the titles of Ahpop and Ahpop-Camhá. With their defeat, the lineage of the great Quiché rulers was scattered, their descendants blending into the new order brought by the conquerors.</p>

<p>Yet, the memory of the great kings like Balam-Quitzé, Gucumatz, and Quicab lived on in the hearts of the Quiché people. Their stories were passed down, whispered in secret, preserving the legacy of the once-great kingdom.</p>

<h2>Final Reflections</h2>

<p>And so ended the days of the Quiché kings, the builders of Gumarcaah, the rulers of the highlands. The land that once echoed with the songs of the ancestors now lay silent, the temples overgrown, the cities abandoned.</p>

<p>But the stories of the Quiché, their wisdom, and their bravery, remain in the hearts of their descendants. They are not forgotten, for the Popol Vuh, the sacred book, preserves their memory for all time.</p>

<p>Let this book be a reminder to all who read it, of the greatness that once was, and the enduring spirit of the Quiché people. Though their kingdom fell, their legacy lives on, a testament to the resilience and strength of the human spirit.</p>
