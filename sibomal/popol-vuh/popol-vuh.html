        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            The *Popol Vuh*, often referred to as the "Book of the People," is a foundational text of the Quiché Maya, one of the most significant indigenous groups of Mesoamerica. Written in the K'iche' language, the *Popol Vuh* is a rich tapestry of mythology, history, and cultural tradition, documenting the cosmological beliefs, heroic narratives, and genealogical histories of the Quiché people.
        </p>
        <p>
            This translation project aims to bring the *Popol Vuh* to a wider audience, faithfully preserving the essence and nuances of the original K'iche' text while making it accessible to contemporary readers. The translation is structured into four parts, reflecting the natural divisions within the original manuscript:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Part I:</strong> The Creation of the World and the Gods</li>
            <li><strong>Part II:</strong> The Adventures of the Hero Twins</li>
            <li><strong>Part III:</strong> The Genealogy of the Quiché People</li>
            <li><strong>Part IV:</strong> The Migration, Settlement, and Struggles of the Quiché</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The *Popol Vuh* serves as both a religious text and a historical record, providing invaluable insights into the worldview of the Quiché Maya. Its stories of creation, gods, and heroes are deeply intertwined with the cultural identity and spiritual beliefs of the Maya people.
        </p>

            This translation is based on the K'iche' text as preserved in various manuscripts, most notably the Dresden Codex. Care has been taken to remain as close to the original text as possible, while also ensuring that the translation is readable and engaging for modern audiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            The *Popol Vuh* continues to be a subject of academic study and cultural preservation, recognized for its literary significance and its role in understanding the pre-Columbian civilizations of the Americas. By providing this translation, we hope to contribute to the ongoing appreciation and study of this monumental work.
        </p>
        <p>

THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE ANCIENT WORD
    Here we shall write,
    we shall set down the ancient word,
    the narrative,
    the beginning and the origin of all things done in the town of K'iche'.

And here we shall recount:
    we shall bring it to light,
    because it was hidden,
    because it was lost,
        the account,
        the declaration,
        the prayer,
        the invocation of the Creator,
            the Maker,
            the Mother and Father of life,
                of all beings,
                the Giver of Breath,
                the Giver of Heart,
                the Bearer,
                the Sustainer,

                    the Mighty Mountain,
                    the Great Earthquake.
Here is the account,
    the beginning and the origin,
    of all that was done in the town of K'iche'.
</pre>

<h2>Chapter 2: The Creation of the Earth</h2>
<pre>
AND THEN THE EARTH WAS SHAPED
    The waters were separated, and the land appeared.
        Mountains rose, and valleys sank.
        The waters were divided, and the land was formed.
        The mountains stood high, and the valleys lay low.
        The plains spread out, and the forests grew.
        The rivers and streams flowed, filling the earth with life.
    And the Creator and Maker said: "Let there be light."
        And there was light, and the sky was brightened.
    The sun and the moon were placed in the sky.
    The stars were set in their places to guide the way.
</pre>

<h2>Chapter 3: The Creation of Life</h2>
<pre>
AND THEN THE CREATION OF LIFE BEGAN
    The birds were created, and they filled the sky with their songs.
    The animals were created, and they roamed the earth.
    The fish were created, and they swam in the waters.
    The plants were created, and they grew across the land.
    The Creator and Maker saw that it was good,
        but they desired more.
        They desired beings who could speak,
            who could worship and praise them.
</pre>

<h2>Chapter 4: The First Attempts at Creation</h2>
<pre>
AND THEN THEY ATTEMPTED TO CREATE BEINGS WHO COULD SPEAK
    They formed beings out of mud,
        but they were weak and crumbled.
    They formed beings out of wood,
        but they were stiff and empty.
    The beings of wood multiplied,
        but they had no hearts and no minds.
    They could not remember their Makers.
        They were hollow and walked without purpose.
    The beings of wood were destroyed,
        swept away by the waters,
        and their faces were crushed by the flood.
</pre>

<h2>Chapter 5: The Creation of the First Humans</h2>
<pre>
AND THEN THE FIRST HUMANS WERE CREATED
    The Creator and Maker decided to use maize,
        the sacred food, to create beings who could worship and sustain them.
    They formed the flesh of the first humans from maize.
    The first humans were four in number:
        Balam-Quitzé,
        Balam-Acab,
        Mahucutah,
        Iqui-Balam.
    These were the names of the first fathers,
        the first humans created by the gods.
    They were strong and wise,
        they knew everything,
        and they saw everything.
    But the gods feared their power,
        so they clouded their vision,
            reducing their knowledge.
    Thus, the first humans came into being,
        and they praised their Makers.
</pre>

<h2>Chapter 6: The Gift of Knowledge</h2>
<pre>
AND THEN THE GIFT OF KNOWLEDGE WAS GIVEN
    The Creator and Maker granted the first humans knowledge,
        but only enough to sustain them.
    They could see the world, but not beyond it.
    They could understand the earth, but not the heavens.
    They could remember their Makers and give thanks.
    The gods were satisfied,
    and the first humans lived in harmony with the earth.
</pre>

<h2>Chapter 7: The Establishment of the Nations</h2>
<pre>
AND THEN THE NATIONS WERE ESTABLISHED
    After the creation of the first humans,
        their descendants began to multiply.
    The tribes and nations spread across the land,
        each establishing its own identity and customs.
    They built cities, established laws, and created societies.
    The gods watched over them, guiding their progress and ensuring their prosperity.
    The people honored their creators with rituals and offerings,
        never forgetting their origins and the sacred nature of maize.
    The nations grew strong, and their influence spread across the earth.
    But with power came responsibility, and the people were reminded
        of the importance of maintaining balance with the natural world.

    The gods were displeased with his vanity,
        and they decided to humble him.
    Hunahpu and Xbalanque, the Hero Twins, were tasked with this mission.
    They set a trap for Seven Macaw, using his greed and pride against him.
    Seven Macaw fell into the trap, losing his teeth and his power.

    The twins were wise beyond their years, and they understood the nature of the world.
    They set out on a journey to challenge the lords of Xibalba,
        the underworld, where their father had been taken.

<h2>Chapter 4: The Trials in Xibalba</h2>
<pre>
AND THEN THEY ENTERED THE UNDERWORLD

    The lords of Xibalba, who had defeated their father, welcomed them with treachery.
    The twins faced many trials and tests, designed to break their spirit.
    They were sent through houses of darkness, cold, and danger.
        But the twins were clever and resourceful, outwitting the lords at every turn.
    They used their wisdom and magic to survive each trial.
    Finally, they challenged the lords to a ballgame, the same game in which their father had been defeated.
